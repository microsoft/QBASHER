QBASHER version history
-----------------------
Sorry, didn't start recording until version 1.1.11

*** V1.1.11  developer1 11 Dec 2014 ***
QBASHI - Record QBASHER_VERSION in the .if file header
	   - NOTE: various error conditions may cause this to take an error exit.
QBASHQ - When debugging or in batch mode, report on the version number of both QBASHQ and the index
	   - When -display_col is zero, return the full record from the .forward file (all columns)
	   - Add a -duplicate_handling option to allow duplicate
	     elimination to be switched off or varied (eventually)
	   - Make -max_candidates default to IUNDEF (undefined
	   integer). If not explicitly set, set it to max_to_show.
	   - Avoid SEGFAULT (missing argument in printf) when an index file can't be accessed.
	   - Start to implement policy of error_exit for any error detectable at start-up and try to warn and recover in every other case
		 - add checks for empty and invalid options in assign_one_arg()
		 - add exit_on_error param to assign_one_arg() - call
		   with TRUE when parsing command line and FALSE when
		   parsing options in a query batch.
		 - check that calls to error_exit() and exit() conform to the policy
			- arg_parser.cpp
			- relaxtion.cpp
			- QBASH_lib.cpp
			- saat.cpp
			- QBASHQ.cpp
			(Done.  Note that error exits are still taken if system thread calls fail.)
	  - DLL:  Split QBASHQ into a DLL and a calling main.   Had to change to build with a dynamically linked CRT (C Runtime Library) otherwise 
	          two copies of the static CRT are linked in and the file descriptor tables for main and DLL don't correspond.  E.g. you can't 
			  pass FILE * arguments to DLL functions and stdout is not the same in the two places.
	  - Reorganized the source to facilitate sticking in TFS.

*** V1.1.12  developer1 22 Dec 2014 ***

QBASHQ - Restructure the use of query_output and query_stream file descriptors to allow static linking (see DLL comment in previous version.  
QBASHQ-LIB is now built as a static .lib.  Tests pass.

*** V1.1.13  developer1 24 Dec 2014 ***

QBASHQ - Remove almost all of the FILE * arguments to functions, to simplify the API. 
			- All test functions and exit messages go to stderr
			- Normally expected output goes to
			qoenv->query_output, passed across by passing
			qoenv, not the member.

*** V1.1.14  developer1 07 Jan 2015 ***

QBASHQ - Fixed segfault in possibly_record_candidate check of repeated
query words

*** V1.2.0  developer1 23 Jan 2015 ***

a. Add minval and maxval members to the arg_t struct and add code in assign_one_arg() to force argument values into
the minval .. maxval range.  (Can be turned off if assign_one_arg() is called with enforce_limits == FALSE)
b. Set a high default for timeout_kops to prevent excessively excessive runtimes.
c. Increase MAX_TRIGGER_LEN from 200 to 4000. I thought I'd already done this
d. Define MAX_RESULT_LEN as 2000 and avoid result strings longer than this.
e. QBASHI: Write file lengths of .forward, .dt, .vocab into the .if header.
f. QBASHI: Write the length of the .if into the last 8 bytes of the .if file.
g. QBASHQ: Check the file lengths and exit if there's a problem.
h. QBASHQ: When using the file_query_stream option, open the file with "rb" flags so that ctrl-Z isn't treated as EOF
i. QBASHQ: Correctly handle the empty phrase case "" - It was causing a segfault
j. QBASHQ: Improvements to normalize_delimiters() to ensure unbalanced quotes or brackets don't get through - It was causing a segfault
k. QBASHQ: saat_setup_disjunction() and saat_setup_phrase() to avoid crash if unbalanced quotes or brackets do get there.

---- TF label "1.2.0 - with support for shards" src /recursive


*** V1.2.1  developer1 23 Jan 2015 ***

QBASHQ: Very widespread changes to remove support for shards:
	- Running a huge set of queries with 1.2.0 resulted in code 1450 errors from the CreateEvent call associated with
	  firing up the shard threads, after about 16.7 million queries
	- it complicated the code significantly (and was only used for AS demo, now no longer needed)
	- Mark Atherton argued that aggregation should be done at a higher level
	- Found a bug when copying results in handle_one_query() (incrementing i before copying)

Unfortunately, dropping support for shards has massive implications for the test suite, which still haven't been fully worked through.
Running 'mississippi state university' with relaxation_level=1 no longer finds colorado state university.  That needs to be debugged.

Unfortunately the new version avoided the code 1450 errors but the program failed at about the same 
point (34 bits worth of queries.  Is that significant?)  This time with WAIT_FAILED error cod

e 6 (Invalid Handle).
It turned out that the fault was not in the library but in the calling program - the event handles created one per 
thread were never closed.  Fixing that allowed QBASHQ to run 92 million queries against both a lyrics and a paper title
index and terminate normally.

--- All tests pass (after modifications necessitated by merging the two shards of the AS_500k index ***

*** V1.2.2  developer1 29 Jan 2015 ***

QBASHQ:  Substantial rewrite to handle all error conditions in the API library by cleaning up and sending an error code 
back to the caller.  All output should also be suppressed unless debug mode is activated.
	- During testing of the changes I noticed that handle_one_query() was incorrectly making use of the global query 
	  environment rather than the local one.  Now fixed.

*** V1.2.3  developer1 30 Jan 2015 ***
QBASHQ:  Previous version crashed after encountering an empty phrase within a disjunction after 281 million queries out of a batch
of 1.3 billion.   The low-level routine passed back an error code but the higher levels didn't handle it properly.  Fixed that and
also added extra code to remove empty phrases and disjunctions from the query.  (Belt + Braces)

To make it easier to debug future errors of this type, an additional Milestone: line is output which reports how many bytes 
have been read from the input file. If that value is K then you can use  'tail -c +K | head -20000' to grab 20000 lines 
around the point of the error.

Milestone: 13083000 queries run; Total elapsed time 728 sec.  Pagefile usage 11372KB
Milestone: Input file offset (approximate): 267277919



*** V1.2.3  developer1 30 Jan 2015 ***
QBASHQ:  Promote the input file offset from off_t to long long, since it seems VS doesn't make offsets 64-bit even when 
the application is 64-bit.

Still to address:  the use of non-reentrant versions of strtol, strtod etc.

*** v1.2.4 developer1 03 Feb 2015 ***

QBASHI:  Problems indexing classificationPaper collection on redsar02.  Same executable on same data works fine
         on my laptop but generates various errors relating to writing files when run on redsar.  Redsar was also taking
		 a huge amount of time during the indexing pass where it is actually indexing the data.
		   
		 - Write problems turned out to be something to do with the fact that the QBASHER/indexes/classificationPaper
		   directory was created by another user.  It didn't even work for me to delete all the files which QBASHI writes. I
		   had to create .doctable, .vocab and .if files using vi and then QBASHI.exe worked fine.  I guess I must have
		   the wrong options to CreateFile()

		- Slowness:  During indexing Task Manager showed QBASHI.exe to be using only a tiny percentage of CPU, hence I
		  needed to speed up I/O.  I used the buffered_write() function on the .doctable file which is used on .if and
		  .vocab.  It made a massive difference:  592 seconds for the slow pass dropped to 29 seconds! 
		  (Incidentally I reduced the size of the HUGE buffer from 10MB to 1MB.  That caused no slow-down at all.)

*** v1.2.5 developer1 05 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHI:  Arrange to always print the QBASHER version number, via print_version_and_options() or print_usage()
QBASHQ:  Add a print_qbasher_version() function to the API, and arrange for the main program to print QBASHER version 
		 and index format in the appropriate circumstances.
QBASHI:  Change the code which allocates the initial size of the hash table to actually make the size vary:
			- for linear scan, based on the max_docs parameter
			- for reordered scan, based on the actual number of docs encountered in the first pass.
         Prior to running the very last phase (writing .vocab and .if) which was impossibly slow when indexing the
		 concatenation of all 6 AS shards on redsar, provide detailed reports of memory usage so that we don't have
		 to wait ages until indexing finishes to find out why things were slow.

*** v1.2.6 developer1 05 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHI:	 allocate_hashtable_and_heap() - reduce the thresholds for increasing the number of hashbits to 
		 reduce likelihood of doubling.
		 - When printing memory use stats, record the time elapsed since the last such summary (so we can 
		   see when things start to bog down.)

*** v1.2.7 developer1 05 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHI:  Arrange to fflush(stdout) in a couple of key places so that a person monitoring the logfile of a big
		 indexing run can quickly confirm that the right indexer and options have been chosen and things are happening.
		 
*** v1.2.8 developer1 14 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHQ:  Add a new module, classification.[ch], and two new options classifier_mode and classifier_threshold to
         as a first step toward implementing a classifier capability.
		 
*** v1.2.9 developer1 15 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHQ: Significant refinements to the classification mode.  Now the system returns the highest scoring result
	    if the classification decision is Yes and no results if the decision is No.
		Still to consider:
			- Biasing toward title matches for lyrics -- best done by incorporating in the static score (I believe that may be
			  already done.)
			- Designing and implementing rules for saying No if the results are ambiguous.
			- Early termination.  To ensure we find an exact match if present, we need to consider very many 
			  candidates.  That slows things down.  Perhaps saat_relaxed_and() can stop early if it finds 
			  a full exact match.  (That one will rank first because it must have the highest static score of
			  all the exact matches.)
			- Relaxation mode.   How much relaxation should we dial up?  Should we do multiple runs?
			- The code for finding a matching span in the classifier() function looks for only one span which
			  will underestimate the true score when query words are repeated in the doc.  E.g. if Q = {love me do}
			  and D = {love, love me do} the code will find the span from 0..3 not the one from 1..3


*** v1.2.10 developer1 16 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHQ: Early termination: Overhaul the classification mechanism to try to reduce the response time for queries that actually 
        match.  We now calculate a classification score in possibly_record_candidate().  If possibly_record_candidate()
		finds an exact lexical match, then it returns a code of 2, and that is treated by saat_and() and saat_relaxed_and()
		as a signal to terminate.  The job to be done by the classifier is thus just to sort by the recorded scores.

		Discovery:  There are songs called 'Google', 'Facebook', and 'eBay'!

		Added three new options:
			-classifier_min_words -  Just return No if the query has fewer than the specified number of words
			-classifier_max_words -  Just return No if the query has more than the specified number of words
			-classifier_lyrics_mode - Doesn't do anything yet, but will preprocess queries containing, e.g. "lyrics of X" and bias the 
			                          classification decision toward Yes by e.g. halving the threshold.

		Suggested options when running in classifier mode:

			-classifier_mode=1  // No other non-zero values are yet supportedq
			-classifier_threshold=0.75  // This is the default - it seems reasonable for the moment
			-max_candidates=1000 // Increase chances that an exact match will be found if there is one
			-max_to_show=1  // Only going to show one "answer"

			plus new options as required.  In Academic Paper triggering it probably makes sense to set classifier_min_words to 
			3 or more since the shorter matches are very dodgy even if exact.  Setting classifier_max_words to say 16 probably 
			avoids wasted effort on queries which are excessively long.  Note that queries are truncated to MAX_WDS_IN_QUERY 
			(32) anyway, but this option avoids considering them at all.  Values above MAX_WDS_IN_QUERY actually have no effect.

*** v1.2.11 developer1 18 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHI:  Added -max_line_prefix= option to allow indexing of prefixes of the first word on a line.  They are indexed with a
		 a leading '>' If the option is given then '>' is removed from the other_token_breakers set.  To query for a line 
		 prefix just search for the prefix you want with a prepended '>'.   The number of postings for each of the line_prefix 
		 terms is limited to 100 by default but this can be altered using -max_line_prefix_postings=
QBASHQ:  No change required, because it reads the other_token_breakers string from the .if header

		 Example usage:

		 blah/QBASHI.exe index_dir=blah -max_line_prefix=16 -max_line_prefix_postings=100 > index.log
		 blah/QBASHQ.exe index_dir=blah -pq=">bail"

		 763M    QBASH/indexes/Top100M/QBASH.doctable
		 2.7G    QBASH/indexes/Top100M/QBASH.forward
		 1.2G    QBASH/indexes/Top100M/QBASH.if  (was 996M)
		 568M    QBASH/indexes/Top100M/QBASH.vocab  (was 172M)

*** v1.2.12 developer1 19 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHQ:  Adding the ability to recognize the lyrics vertical intent in a query, when -classifier_vertical=lyrics is given.
		1. added new modules shared/utility_nodeps.cpp and .h with a few QBASHER-independent string functions
		2. added () function to classification.cpp to recognize the vertical intent and strip intent words out of query
		3. added vertical_intent_detected flag to qex  
		4. if the vertical_intent_detected flag is set, 1.0 is added to scores.


*** v1.2.13 developer1 23 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHQ:  1. Slight speedup of lookup_word() by calling strcmp (with casting) rather than an inbetween function to do the cast.
         2. Moved a bunch of functions from qbashq-lib to shared/utility_nodeps
		 3. Implemented classifier_mode=2.  
			a. Implemented a modified dave formula using idf sums rather than counts
			b. When classifier_mode == 2, the QBASH.global_idfs file is memory mapped.  If it doesn't exist this is treated as an error
			c. A new function get_global_idf() uses binary search within the global_idfs mapping to retrieve the idf value
			d. If not found, a default score is returned.  Currently that's set to three, because I don't think that a term which is non-existent 
			   on the web should necessarily get a huge IDF score.
Build_globalidf_from_TSV - A new application which builds the .global_idfs file (sorted in the order expected by QBASHQ) from a TSV file
            in which column 1 has the word and the global DF is in a column specified on the command line.


*** v1.2.14 developer1 23 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHQ:  1. Add an auto_line_prefix option to automatically prepend the '>' when the input query contains no space.  This option is ignored
		    if the index has not been built with the -max_line_prefix option set nono-zero.   Currently that is detected by looking for a double
			question-mark in the other_token_breakers string.  To make it more explicit in the .if header would preferably require an index
			format change but, at the moment this is only a prototype demo, so a little hack should be OK.

*** v1.2.15 developer1 23 Feb 2015 ***
QBASHQ:  1. Fixing bug reported by Developer2:  The 'vertical intent detected' message was printed regardless of the outcome of apply_lyrics_specific_rules()
		 2. Changing vertical intent detected message to include the original query as well as the modified one. (As requested by Developer2)
		 3. Print "No explicit vertical intent signal" if the result of apply_lyrics_specific_rules() is zero

*** v1.2.16 developer1 24 Feb 2015 ***
 QBASHQ: 1. implemented bag_similarity() and used it in a prototype ambiguous answer detector when running as a classifier.  Needs more work.

*** v1.2.17 developer1 04 Mar 2015 ***
 QBASHQ: 1. Reverting to building QBASHQ as a front-end EXE and a DLL since the Object Store will use a DLL
		 2. Added new QBASHsharp project - a C# main program to call the DLL
		 3. Trivial changes to qbashq-lib made during integration of QBASHsharp and the API.  E.g. adding a few more error message 
		    definitions and returning error codes from finalize_query_processing_environment() instead of writing to stderr

*** v1.2.18 developer1 04 Mar 2015 ***
 QBASHQ: 1. Altered the substitute() function to allow a mode where the pattern to be replaced is treated as though it started 
			and ended with \b
		 2. Modified apply_lyrics_specific_rules() to change the rules so that Developer2's test script 'qbash_modifyLyricsQueries_check.pl'
		    passes.
		 3. Modified Developer2's script to expect the stripping out of 'lyrics by', so that 'roar lyrics by katy perry' becomes 'roar katy perry'
			
*** v1.2.19 developer1 09 Mar 2015 ***
  QBASHQ: A few minor tweaks to facilitate calling the API from C-sharp.  In particular adding an extract_result_at_rank() function. 
			- The C-Sharp front end is in TFS as QBASHQsharp

*** v1.2.20 developer1 10 Mar 2015 ***
 QBASHQ:  extract_result_at_rank() needs to return the length of the string too, cause C# doesn't handle null-termination.

 *** v1.2.21 developer1 20 Mar 2015 ***  -- DLL changes to support Object Store OneBox integration
 QBASHQ:  1. QBASHQ_lib.* - Insert some functions Native....() which will be the ones called from
          ObjectStore.  In ObjectStore, we will be given a list of filenames from an unpacked tarfile: 
			the four index files and a config file.
		  2. Added an object_store_files= option to test the processing of such a list of files. 
		  3. Add an additional option file_config to allow specification of options via a config file.  
		  4. New function in arg_parser.cpp - assign_args_from_config(), called from finalize_query_processing_environment() 
		     before it takes the other actions.

*** v1.2.22 developer1 17 April 2015 ***  -- Fixing problem with matching partials
QBASHI:   1. Fixing calculate_signatures_from_first_letters() to do ASCII case-folding (really must tackle the UTF-8 project 
             soon!) and to use the token-break set rather than just space.  The ability to match partials hadn't been maintained
			 since RevIDX came on the scene and indexer and query processor had drifted out of sync resulting in missed answers.
		  2. Fix up the internal test to match new semantics
		  3. Add a new perl test qbash_bloombits_check.pl

*** v1.2.23 developer1 20 April 2015 ***  -- Fixing slow combination of classifier_mode and relaxation_level
QBASHQ:   1. relaxation.cpp:saat_relaxed_and() -  if classifier_mode > 0 don't allow the relaxation level to cause consideration
			 of candidates which can't possibly reach the classification threshold.  This change more-or-less quadrupled the QPS
			 rate on a test set of queries.
QBASHI/Q: 2. process_trigger() -- The trigger is defined as all the characters from the beginning of the line to the first tab.  
			 I found that when there was a control character in the trigger, the control character was indexed as a word.  So
			 "control ^M character" would be indexed as 3 words.  HOWEVER, in QBASHQ the ^M was treated as a line terminator, and
			 the word count for the above example string was 1.  This led to a SEGFAULT when processed by extract_text_features()
			 or classification_score().   Now both QBASHQ and QBASHI treat the ctrl-M as a token-break character and give the 
			 length of 2 for the example string.
	
*** v1.2.24 developer1 23 April 2015 ***  -- 		
QBASHQ:   1. Found that classifier_mode=1 produced fewer matches than special_matching=2 which should not be the case.  Turned
			 out to be because of query normalisation in one case but not the other.  Arranged to remove operators and normalize
			 the query when classifier_mode > 0.
		  2. Implement classifier_modes 3 (Jaccard similarity) and 4 (IDF weighted Jaccard)

*** v1.2.25 developer1 24 April 2015 ***  -- 		
QBASHQ:   1. Needed to do more operator stripping in the special_matching modes because queries in square brackets are
             otherwise treated as disjunctions leading to answers which are not exact.
		  2. Timeout_kops now defaults to zero (unlimited) to avoid occasional mysteries
		  3. Fix major error in calculation of swaps in classification_score()  *** STILL NEEDS WORK ***
		  4. Extend classifier() function to properly handle partial matches thrown up when relaxation_level is non-zero

+++ Index Format Change (version 1.3) +++ -- changed widths of fields in doctable entries to allow 42 bit offsets into .forward 
*** v1.3.0 developer1 29 April 2015 ***  -- 		
Common definitions:  1. Change the various DTE_ defines to reduce WDCNT, SCORE and BLOOM while increasing OFFSET
					 2. Introduce definitions of WDPOS_BITS and WDPOS_MASK because outside the doctable WDPOS quantities
					    remain at 8 bits.  ALso define DTE_WDCNT_MAX  to be 31
QBASHQ:				 1. A few changes to deal with the fact that when the Doctable wdcnt says 31 it might actually be a 
						larger value.
					 2. In classification_score(), if the doctable says length == 31, compute the actual word count.
						
*** v1.3.1 developer1 30 April 2015 ***  -- Improve precision of timing
QBASHQ/I:  Replace all calls to clock() with calls to the QueryPerformance system, as recommended in MSDN doco:
			https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn553408(v=vs.85).aspx
			QueryPerformanceCounter() and QueryPerformanceFrequency() are the basis of the function msec_elapsed_since()
			now defined in utility_nodeps.cpp.

			The reason for this work is that maximum and 99th percentile response times for a large batch of queries
			against a small index were always reported as 15 or 16 msec, while 95% of queries were run in less than
			1 msec.  Investigation revealed that which queries were slow was totally random.  My guess is that the 
			timer used by clock() is only updated about 67 times per second. Which means that all queries appear to
			run in 0 msec, except the ones which occur around a clock update.

			The QPC system seems to overcome this problem.

+++ Index Format Change (version 1.4) +++ -- changed the definition of skipblock headers to allow up to 100 billion docs
*** v1.4.0 developer1 30 April 2015 ***  
Common definitions:  1. Move the typedef for docnum_t to here.
					 2. No longer store lastwdnum in skipblock headers.  Remove the sb_get_lastwdnum(x) macro
					 3. Adjust the bitfield widths to 37 (docnum), 12 (postings in run) + 15 (bytes in run)
QBASHI:				 1. Try to consistently use docnum_t for document numbers
QBASHQ:				 1. Remove use of sb_get_lastwdnum(x)

*** v1.4.1 developer1 01 May 2015 ***  
QBASHI:	 1. Progress reports written in the log, wrote the docnumber in %d rather than %I64d format.  That results in 
			negative numbers and wrap-around for numbers larger than 2**31.
		 2. Trying to explain why the writing of .vocab and .if on redsar is incredibly slow.  (About 3 hours to write 10GB, that's only 
		    about 1 MB/sec. Redsar doesn't seem to be paging -  TaskManager only reports 66% memory usage.)
			a. Checked (via printfs on laptop) that the megabyte buffering seemed to be doing the right thing. 
			b. Removed all the sharing permissions on CreateFile calls - they relate to other processes simultaneously
			   accessing the open file, rather than the permissions the file will have when closed.
		 3. Arranged to fflush(stdout) at critical points in the indexing process.


*** v1.4.2 developer1 05 May 2015 ***  
QBASHQ:	 1. Fix up a couple of issues in error handling, particularly when index version incompatibility is detected.  
			(That issue was causing a segfault.)

*** v1.4.3 developer1 05 May 2015 ***  
QBASHI:	 1. Fixing recently introduced bug in recording word counts in doctable when doc is longer than 32 words.
QBASHQ:  2. Suppressing annoying CPU and statistics logging when warm_indexes is TRUE.

*** v1.4.4 developer1 11 May 2015 ***  
QBASHQ:	 1. Arrange to support -max_length_diff=100 as a means of switching on a dynamic setting of the length difference
			limit.  (Limit = (|Q| * |Q|) / (|Q| + 2) + R, where R is the relaxation level)
		 2. Timeouts in classifier_modes weren't working properly because the op counter was not being updated when 
		    classification_score was called.  Fixed that
		 3. Added extra counters for term dictionary lookups, rank-only term evaluations, and Bloom filter checks.

*** v1.4.5 developer1 14 May 2015 ***  
Utility_nodeps:  Restoring the FILE_SHARE_READ attribute to the CreateFile() call within open_file_ro(), withdrawn in 1.4.1.
		    It didn't make much difference to runtime and it's absence prevents more than one QBASHQ from querying the same index.

*** v1.4.6 developer1 17 May 2015 ***   Gearing up to do some performance monitoring
QBASHI:		1. Added two Xperimental options x-hashbits, x-hashprobe to allow control of performance measurement experiments
			2. Improved the reporting of elapsed times
				- Added extra timing points (time to write the .if file, total scanning time for sorted-scan)

*** v1.4.7 developer1 20 May 2015 ***   Capacity and memory compactness improvements
QBASHI:		1. Sorted indexing didn't work when there are more than 2 billion documents because of use of 
	           ints in various places.
			2. Changed the vocabulary entries in the hash table to use 5-byte composite DOH references rather than 
			   8-byte pointers.
			3. Upgraded a whole lot of variables in process_records_in_score_order() to u_ll (unsigned long long).
			   To date, this function failed for more than 2^31 docs
QBASHQ:		4. When checking the text of a candidate for matches against partial words in the query, the code now
			   uses the same test as elsewhere rather than just breaking on spaces.  The incompatibility led to 
			   a difference in behaviour observed by Developer2 for the query {an ontology based query system for digital libraries}
			   when run with and without auto_partials.

*** v1.4.8 developer1 20 May 2015 ***  Found what "Code Analysis" does in VS and used it to tidy up a few small issues.
QBASHQ:      1. While doing this, noticed that the number of parallel query streams was limited in a second place
				to 12 (arrays are statically allocated).  Increased that limit to 100 and made the limit in arg_parser.c match.

*** v1.4.9 developer1 21 May 2015 ***  Experimenting with Virtual Memory Large Pages in QBASHI
			1. Add x_use_large_pages option to allow turning on and off.
			2. Add Privileges() function to set the lock memory privilege and to handle failure.
			3. Add lp_malloc() and lp_free() functions which switch between large pages and ordinary 
				depending upon x_use_large_pages and call them for allocating DOH blocks.

				*** UNFORTUNATELY: Can't use large pages to map the forward file.
				"SEC_LARGE_PAGES: This attribute is not supported for file mapping objects that are backed by executable image 
				files or data files""

*** v1.4.10 developer1 27 May 2015 ***  Linked list chunking in QBASHI
			1. Change the DOH definitions in linked_list.cpp to store bytes in each block rather than linked_list_element counts.
			2. Implement -x_chunk_func=<int> to specify the type and parameters of the chunking function to use.
				0 means unchunked (or fixed size 1 chunks)
				1 - 100 means fixed size chunks of that size
				101 means Fibonacci with runs of length 1
				102 means Fibonacci with runs of length Fib(k)
			3. In QBASHI.cpp calculate_k_table() is called with the x_chunk_func value to set up tables to control the 
			   chunking.
			4. doh_allocate() modified to allow allocation of size based on K the current chunk size
		    5. Append_posting() modified to calculate value of K from the count of postings for this term
			6. write_inverted_file() modified to work with chunked lists.

*** v1.4.11 developer1 28 May 2015 ***  Linked list chunking in QBASHI (tidy up)
			1. QBASHI.cpp:allocate_hashtable_and_heap() -  take account that allocation sizes are now entries rather than bytes.  Too few 
			   blocks were being allocated in some circ.s
			2. Add two more entries to the DOH header to count doh requests and total of doh request sizes
			3. Patch up size reporting in the log to give a full picture in a chunking environment
			4. Unfortunately, improvements in logging mean changes in format of logging.

*** v1.4.12 developer1 31 May 2015 ***  Fix a capacity typo in QBASHI 
			1. QBASHI.cpp:calculate_k_table only iterated to 100 million not 100 billion.  On an artificial collection with 
			   500 million postings for one term, QBASHI blew up.  Fixed the typo.
		    2. linked_list.h: increased the max number of entries in the k table to 4096 from 512.

*** v1.4.13 developer1 03 June 2015 ***  Implement variable skip block lengths.  Doesn't require any change in QBASHQ
			1. QBASHI: Allow -sb_run_length to take a zero length and use it to request dynamic setting of 
			   skip block run lengths to the square root of the list length (up to the maximum of 4096)
			2. Implement this with a very small change to the skip block section in write_inverted_file()
		 
*** v1.4.14 developer1 03 June 2015 ***  Adding an experimental ability to list the response times for each query in a batch
			1. QBASHQ: add -x_show_qtimes option.  It forces query_streams=1 and outputs response times in the form:
					QTIME: <query as processed> TAB <elapsed msec>

*** v1.4.15 developer1 05 June 2015 ***  Changing defaults to reflect last week of experiments
	QBASHI: 1. Default to x_chunk_func=102:  Significantly cuts memory requirements during indexing and also time to index
			2. Default to dynamic skip blocks and trigger of 500

*** v1.4.16 developer1 06 June 2015 ***  Experiment with avoiding mmapping .forward when records are not to be sorted.
	QBASHI: 1. -x_fileorder_use_mmap option.

*** v1.4.17 developer1 08 June 2015 ***  One step further: A buffer-filling thread.
	QBASHI: 1. Added a module input_buffer_management.cpp/h to control forward file input from separate thread.
			2. Modified get_line() and process_records_in_file_order() to interact with the input_buffer_management 
			   functions.
			3. Needed to modify the CreateFile() call (turn off buffering) to get reasonable performance.   It's 
			   still no better than the old version :-(

*** v1.4.18 developer1 10 June 2015 ***  Trying to overcome a drastic speed drop associated with IDF-based classifier_modes
	QBASHQ: 1. Dynamic setting of max_length_diff.  If a max_length_diff parameter greater than 100 is specified (up to 999), then 
		       the value is interpreted as length_cutoff * 100 + addon.  E.g. 402 means wordmax = 4 and addon = 2.  For queries up 
			   to and including length_cutoff in length the max_length_diff will be dynamically set to:

				|Q|^2 / (|Q| + 2) + relaxation_level + addon.   

				In the dynamic setting mode, no max_length_diff restriction is applied for queries longer than length_cutoff

		// In classifier_modes 2 and 4, the classification score is based on sums of IDF values.  When the queries are short
		// and the records are long, QPS rates and latencies deteriorate, sometimes very dramatically (factor of 100 in QPS)
		// due to the need to look up the IDF for every term in every candidate.  But most of this computation is wasted.
		// Setting max_length_diff to 401 means that the actual length diff maximum is set dynamically for queries up to 4
		// words in length.  Note that this change will not occur if an explicit max_length_diff value has been specified.

*** v1.4.19 developer1 18 June 2015 ***  QBASHI changes to improve performance reporting.
			1. linked_list.cpp:doh_print_usage_report() -  Print total number of allocate requests, sum of request sizes and average request size.
			2. arrange to report page fault counts for each indexing phase.
			3. Be more thorough in logging the indexing options in force for the current run.
			4. Add another experimental option -x_minimize_io  to suppress the writing of the index files.

*** v1.4.20 developer1 19 June 2015 ***  QBASHQ changes to support classifier_mode=magic_songs
			1. Add small function to classifier.cpp to make string mods.  Tested with printfs

*** v1.4.21 developer1 22 June 2015 ***  QBASHI changes to support storing short linked_lists within the hash table
			1. Change VOCAB_ENTRY_SIZE from 16 to 18
			2. New option and variable:  x_2postings_in_vocab
			3. Make x_2postings_in_vocab-dependent changes in process_a_word() and write_inverted_file() to store
			   postings lists of lengths 1 and 2 in the hashtable entries.
			4. Make changes to calculate_k_table to implement power, sub-power and super-power functions.
				200k - sub-power with k specified by the last digit
				300k - power with k specified by the last digit
				400k - super-power with k specified by the last digit

*** v1.4.22 developer1 23 June 2015 ***  
	QBASHQ:  Fix fname_query_batch in QBASHQ.cpp error message.
	QBASHI:	 1. move the statement which sets pfc_list_scan_start to AFTER the allocation of the permute()
		     2. When x_minimize_io=true, don't even write stuff into the buffer.  buffered_write() just returns straight away.
			
*** v1.4.23 developer1 24 June 2015 ***  
    QBASHI:	 1. Implement two functions to estimate the doccount for a collection based on sampling, one when the .forward
				is mmapped but not sorted by weight, and the other for when mmap is not used.  The code has been tested on
				a range of collections from 2 docs to 89 million and produced estimates within 3 or 4%, usually much closer 
				(except for the 2 doc collection when the error is very small in absolute terms.)
			2. Use the estimate in allocating a hashtable of suitable size.
			3. Fix a bug which caused an infinite loop when mmapping but not sorting and the last record in the file was 
			   empty.   That happened for the 2-doc collection (which actually has 3) -- It would be much more concerning
			   if this happened in a much longer file.

*** v1.4.24 developer1 24 June 2015 ***  Starting on using compression in linked list chunks.
	QBASHI:	  1. Replacing ve_pack455() and ve_unpack455() with ve_pack4552() and ve_unpack4552() to allow storing a 
				chunk count in the vocabulary hashtable.
				
*** v1.4.25 developer1 28 June 2015 ***  Fixing an indexer bug associated with zero scores in records.
				The problem is visible in the following tiny collection:

				The only record with a non-zero score   10000
				scotch vodka rum cognac brandy 0
				cougar duck elephant    0

				Regardless of the order in which records are indexed, QBASHI reports 16 postings from 1 docs.  Queries 
				{scotch} and {elephant} return "The only record ..." with a score of zero!  Query {record} returns 
				"The only record ..." with a non-zero score.

				In both modes we should index every record.  If a record's score is zero or negative, we just count
				it as zero, or one (if we are taking logs, as we do when sorting.)

				In the case of sorting, we know the highest score, so we can normalize all scores to lie between 
				0 and 1.

				In the case of non-sorting we don't know how to normalize scores because we don't know what the maximum
				is.  Up until now we've just divided by a very large number.   A better assumption may be that the 
				records have been pre-sorted with the highest score first.   Let's  assume that's the case and divide
				by the score of the first record (or 1 if the score of the first record is zero or negative.)

	QBASHI:	    1. Remove all the code and comments relating to ctrl-G.  That was autosuggest-specific, not needed any
				   more, and capable of causing mysteries elsewhere
				2. Remove hard-wired score thresholds (which were incorrectly coded anyway and which caused the problem
				   which these changes are addressing.)  Now, a valid record is indexed iff its score is equal to or greater 
				   than the score_treshold (0.0 by default but settable by command line argument)
				3. The command line argument is now score_threshold rather than freq_threshold
				4. Scores and score thresholds may now be floating point numbers.
				5. When indexing in file order, scores are now normalized relative to the score of the first record,
				   unless (A) - a max_score value has been supplied via the command line, or (B) the score of the first
				   record is zero or negative, in which case scores will be divided by 1
				6. Internally, variables which used to be called 'freq' something are now called 'score' something.
				7. Change file_order indexing to use log_ratio quantization the same as score-sorted indexing for greater
				   compatibility between the modes.  When indexing a file which has been pre-sorted in descending score
				   order, the scores recorded should be the same in either indexing mode. 

				   *** Problem collection quoted above produces right results in both indexing modes.
				   *** Tests passes after reindexing

*** v1.4.26 developer1 01 July 2015 ***  Step 2 in using compression in linked list chunks.
	QBASHI:	1. Implemented ve_get_chunk_count(), ve_store_chunk_count(), ve_increment_count(), and ve_increment_chunk_count() macros
			2. test_ve_pup() - add tests of all the macros, new and old.
			3. Implement a ve_store455x() function which leaves the chunk_count as it was.
			4. Change the process_a_word(), append_posting(), and write_inverted_file() functions to use the appropriate
				ve_store*() and ve_get*() functions and to record the chunk_count in the hash table entries, switching
				between the 466 and 4552/455x as appropriate.
			5. Increase the size of the NEXT pointers field in list chunks to 7 bytes.  When NEXT actually serves as a 
				pointer then the first 5 bytes are the composite pointer to the next chunk.  While working on the chunk
				currently at the end of the list, all 7 bytes are used, packed 37 bits for the last_docnum written
				and 19 bits for the number of bytes used in the chunk.
			6. Change doh_allocate() to initialise the allocated chunk to be all ones.
			7. In the chunks write wordpos before docnum.  Since no wordpos is allowed to be all ones, this will
			   make for a simple test of when we've come to the end of the vbyte compressed data in a chunk.
			8. Change append_posting() to use the bytes_used value in the NEXT field to determine where to 
			   write the next payload.  (And write updated bytes_used and last_docnum values into NEXT.)
			9. In calculate_k_tables() prevent a value of K which would cause the 19 bits of bytes_used to
			   overflow.  (Using the validateK() function.)

*** v1.4.27 developer1 02 July 2015 ***  
	QBASHI:	1. Allocate_hashtable_and_heap() - Substantially increase the number of DOH blocks allocated.  
			Increase bytes per doc from 1100 to 5000. Developer2 ran out when using -max_prefix_langth=16 on 
			dataset with long records.


*** v1.4.28 developer1 02 July 2015 ***  Step 3 in using compression in linked list chunks.
	QBASHI:	1. Change calculate_k_tables() to work off chunk number rather than posting number (remembering that
			   chunk numbers are limited to 2^16 - 1 because only 2 bytes are available in the Hashtable entry.)
			   Make sure we don't generate negative numbers.
			2. A major rewrite of append_posting() to work with this new regime
			3. Substantial work on write_inverted_file() to work with this new regime  (In all the b_____ branches.)
			
			Passes qbash_index_modes_test.pl  (at last!)

*** v1.4.29 developer1 03 July 2015 ***  Step 4 (hopefully final) in using compression in linked list chunks.
	QBASHI: 1. Actually implement the v-byte writing and reading code within chunks. Several places in both
			   append_posting() and in write_inverted_file().

			   *** At the moment, write_inverted_file() actually decodes the bytes and then re-encodes them.
			       It might save a little time to just copy them to output.  

*** v1.4.30 developer1 0? July 2015 ***  
	Oops - forgot to document this.

*** v1.4.31 developer1 17 July 2015 ***  
	QBASHI: 1. Implemented the x_sort_postings_instead option.  *** NOTE *** It does enough to enable a check
			   of timing and memory requirements, but it's not actually capable of writing an index.


#################################################################################################################
#	CODING TASKS:
#  CT1. Implement a mode in which a forward file is not read but rather terms and document boundaries are 
#     randomly generated.  This serves too purposes:  It avoids the need to create massive .forward files on disk
#     and eliminates forward file i/o and text scanning from List Build timing.  QBASHI now:
#	    1. Accept ZIPF-GENERATOR as a special value of the index_dir argument.  It should automatically turn on
#		   x_minimize_io and avoid opening any files.  Also, UNIF-GENERATOR and APRX-GENERATOR
#	    2. Four additional parameters will be needed.  (Defaults matching a real collection, e.g idxNoUrl)
#		   1. Total number of postings to generate  (x_synth_postings.  dflt 10 billion)
#		   2. Size of the desired vocabulary (x_synth_vocab_size. dflt 100 million)
#		   3. Desired average document length (x_synth_doc_length.  dflt 10)
#	       4. The desired value of alpha in Zipf.  (x_zipf_alpha dflt -1.0).  Need to work out how to convert that to a power
#	CT2. Add an option x_cpu_affinity to map the processor affinity to a single core (to reduce timing variability?)
#	CT3. Inspect the code and remove any unnecessary statements which could interfere with I-cache residency
#   CT4. Inspect the code to find out why using v-byte doesn't gain speed.
#   CT5. Implement a dynamic array alternative to linked lists.  That's probably quite a big effort - will
#      need to think how to do it.
###################################################################################################################

*** v1.4.32 developer1 17 July 2015 ***  
	QBASHI: 1. Completed CT1 and CT2.  Linked in utils/get_random_numbers.c from Developer2.
			   - Also support APRX_GENERATOR (approximate Zipf) and UNIF-GENERATOR (uniform) special values.
			   - Decided not to hardwire x_minimize_io -- It may be useful to inspect the output files, particularly .vocab
			   - NOTE that you won't be able to run queries against the index because the doctable is empty and
				 there's no .forward file

*** v1.4.33 developer1 23 July 2015 ***  Minor polishing of the changes 1.4.32 changes.
	QBASHI:  1. Tweaking with random term generation
			 2. Automatically setting x_hashbits for synthetic datasets based on the target vocab_size (unless X_hashbits is explicitly set)

*** v1.4.34 developer1 24 July 2015 ***  
	QBASHI: Report hashtable collisions and indexing rate at end of output.

*** v1.4.35 developer1 24 July 2015 ***  
	QBASHI: Trying to do a better job of generating a Zipfian distribution by integrating the Zipf's law curve

*** v1.4.36 developer1 29 July 2015 ***  
	QBASHI: Integrating Developer2's improvements to term generation in gen_random_numbers.cpp.  They actually made collisions worse.

	The Mersenne Twister random number generator

*** v1.4.37 developer1 30 July 2015 ***  
	QBASHI: 1. Adding TinyMT code.   Replacing rand_gen() with front-end to initialise or call tinyMT
		    2. Fixed the maths in getZipfianTermRandomNumber() -  It now works for alpha < - 1.0 (and
				takes an error exit if alpha is too close to -1)

*** v1.4.38 developer1 30 July 2015 ***  

*** v1.4.39 developer2b 25 September 2015 ***  
    QBASHQ: 1. Added in the flag "display_parsed_query" which lets the user display the query after application of the classification segment rules

*** v1.4.40 developer1 30 Sep 2015 ***  
	QBASHI: 1. Changes to QBASHI.cpp:process_records_in_file_order() to ensure that document offsets were updated correctly for all the categories
	           of ignored records.  (Developer2 had found corrupted results in a collection which included empty triggers.)

*** v1.4.41 developer1 30 Sep 2015 ***  
	QBASHQ: 1. Changes to score() function in QBASHQ_lib.cpp to prevent division by zero in length scoring when document. is one word
	           shorter than the query.   Problem reported and faulty code identified by Partha Parthasarathy

*** v1.4.41 developer1 30 Sep 2015 ***  
    QBASHI: 1. New approach to handling the tail part of ZIPF-GENERATOR collections.  New -x_zipf_tail_perc option.  If random number
		       is generated within the singleton term region of the distribution, we just emit the next unused term number.
			2. Output the number of documents indexed in the last few lines of output to make information extraction easier.

*** v1.4.42 developer1 06 Oct 2015 ***    * Adding an option to allow very much larger triggers to be indexed. *
    QBASHI: 1. Increase MAX_TRIGGER_LEN from 4000 to 4000000.
			2. Define MAX_WDS_INDEXED_PER_DOC as MAX_WDPOS + 1  by default
			3. Define new Boolean option x_bigger_trigger.  If TRUE, set MAX_WDS_INDEXED_PER_DOC to 100,000 (max length of an ANU PhD thesis.)
	QBASHQ: 1. Functions which process the document text (e.g. possibly_record_candidate() and extract_text_features()) are still
			   subject to tighter limits:  Up to WDPOS_MASK (255) words and MAX_RESULT_LENGTH (2000) bytes

			The effect of this is that if x_bigger_trigger is FALSE, behaviour is as appropriate for indexing queries, titles, and other 
			short texts.   If QBASHER is required to index and search much longer texts, x_bigger_trigger can be set to TRUE and words beyond
			position 254 will be indexed.  However, all will have their position recorded as 254. 

			------------ CAUTION WHEN USING X_BIGGER_TRIGGER=TRUE.  MISSES and FALSE POSITIVES  ------------------------
			*** This means that phrases later in the document will not match a phrase query, and
			*** There is the potential for false phrase matches.   E.g. say the word at position 253 in a doc is 'united' and the following words
			*** are 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four' then phrases 'united one' (correct), 'united two' (false), 'united three' etc will all match.
			*** There may be other adverse effects on use of classification mode etc too.

*** v1.4.43 developer1 06 Oct 2015 ***    
    QBASHI: 1. TIny tweak to time reporting at the very end. Increased precision

*** v1.4.44 developer2b 10 Oct 2015 ***
    QBASHQ:  Adding the ability to recognize the carousel vertical intent in a query, when -classifier_vertical=carousel is given.
		    1. added apply_carousel_specific_rules() function to classification.cpp to recognize the vertical intent and strip intent words out of query

*** v1.4.45 developer1 14 Oct 2015 ***    
    QBASHQ: 1. Hooking in a PCRE2 project and confirming that we can actually build it.

*** v1.4.46 developer1 15 Oct 2015 ***    
    QBASHI: 1. Implementing a language variable and option.  It currently does nothing.
    QBASHQ: 1. Implementing a use_substitutions variable.  It looks for a QBASH.substitution_rules_EN (or FR, DE etc)
			   in either index_dir or the directory containing QBASH.config.  If found, that file is assumed to contain
			   lines in the form: <regex> TAB <substitution string>
			   Compiled regexes and substitution strings are stored in paralel arrays
			   Incoming queries are subjected to transformations by each of the substitution rules.
			2. The functions for loading and unloading rules and for performing substitutions are in a new
			   substitutions.cpp module.
			3. At the moment, a global substitution is performed, but processing of rules is stopped after the 
			   first successful call to pcre2_substitute()

*** v1.4.47 developer1 19 Oct 2015 ***   Filling code gaps in loading global_idfs and substitution_rules + better error reporting.
    Shared: 1. Now, mmap_all_of() prints error messages giving the error and the name of the file affected.
			   Previously, we had just returned an error code back through the chain of callers, leading to a generic 
			   error message with no way to identify the problem.
	QBASHQ: 2. Until now there was no way to specify .global_idfs and .substitution_rules files in either Aether mode,
	           or in Object store.  There are now options fname_global_idfs and fname_substitution_rules for aether,
			   and the conde which splits up the filename list parameter in ObjectStore now recognizes .global_idfs
			   and .substitution_rules suffixes.  NOTE: In ObjectStore and Aether there is no language suffix to the 
			   .substitution_rules suffix because you can specify the specific file you want.  The language value is
			   still appended in the index_dir case.

*** v1.4.48 developer1 19 Oct 2015 ***   Improving regex substitution mechanism
    Shared: 1. Moved the substitutions from qbashq-lib to shared directory, in case we should want to use the capability in the
	           indexer.  That meant passing individual items to functions, rather than just a pointer to a QP environment.
			   It's the first time I recall using a triple star: pointer to a pointer to a pointer.
			2. Changed apply_substitution_rules() to keep processing rules even if a rule matches
			3. Changed apply_substitution_rules() to cease processing rules if the subject contains '['
			    
*** v1.4.49 developer1 19 Oct 2015 ***   Improving regex substitution mechanism  - better handling of square brackets
			   Item 3 in 1.4.48 was too draconian.   In principle the way it should work is that each time a rule is 
			   considered, it should be applied separately to each of the sections of the subject which are outside square 
			   brackets.  E.g. if the subject is {vaccination of [dogs cats] against [rabies parvovirus] in Melbourne} the rule should be 
			   applied to "vaccination of", "against", and "in Melbourne" and the results must be concatenated with the 
			   square-bracketed sections.   Of course, the square bracketed sections may need to be re-identified after each substitution.
			   This process is potentially time consuming and requiring of a lot of buffer-shuffling.   Potential optimisationgs include
			   preserving knowledge of square bracket locations across substitions which can't or didn't result in extra square brackets.
			   A rule whose RHS doesn't include square brackets can't introduce them into the string.
			1. Introduce an array of byte-wide flags indicating whether the RHS of a substitution rule contains an operator which
			   might cause trouble if substitution were to occur in the wrong context.  substitution_rules_RHS_has_operator[]

*** v1.4.50 developer1 27 Oct 2015 ***   Unsuccessful fiddling with the synthetic collection generation maths.   It's currently buggy, sorry.
	        1. get_random_numbers.cpp: getZipfianTermRandomNumber() - change the maths
			2. qbashq-lib.cpp: possibly_record_candidate() - Apply the substitution rules to the candidate in modes
				and cases where the text needs to be examined.
			3. Give more explanation in the case of arg_parsing errors.
			4. Enhance processing of substitutions.
				- multisub() splits subject string into sections bounded / not-bounded by operators and prevents pattern
				  substitution in operator sections.
			5. In qbashq-lib.cpp:process_qtext(), change the order of application of the various text transformations, so that 
			   we can apply substitution rules relating to apostrophes etc.
			6. Classification:  Instead of strcmp() use term_match() when trying to match query words against candidate words.
			   term_match() does the right thing with simple disjunctions and simple phrases but gives up ("no match") for 
			   nested phrases and disjunctions.  We'll probably have to fix that before long.

*** v1.4.51 developer1 29 Oct 2015 ***   More successful fiddling with synthetic collection generation maths based on 
               approximating the cumulative Zipf curve, still with special coding of the singleton case.
	qbashi: 1. get_random_numbers.c: getZipfianTermRandomNumber() - new version based on the cumulative probability 
	           histogram.  Tidy up the code, remove BALLAST, update comments in various places. 

*** v1.4.52 developer1 29 Oct 2015 ***
	qbashi: 1. Further tidy-ups of synthetic generation.    Using a random seed for the random number generator.  Removing
	           the hard-wiring of the value of alpha.  Printing a progress indicator after every 10 million fake postings
			   indexed.

*** v1.4.53 developer1 02 Nov 2015 ***
	qbashi: 1. Add option -x_fname_synth_docs to allow specification of a filename (path) into which synthetically generated 
	           documents are to be written.  Output is one line per synthetic document.  Each line consists of 
			   a sequence of generated words, followed by a TAB, a weight (currently always 1) and a LineFeed

			   
*** v1.4.54 developer1 02 Nov 2015 ***
	qbashq: 1. qbashq_lib.cpp: process_query_text() -  When in a classification mode, double quotes should be retained,
	           therefore call strip_qbash_operators_except_quotes().  This allows substitution rules to be made for
			   patterns like "lincoln s" which arise in the carousel application.
			   			   
*** v1.4.55 developer1 02 Nov 2015 ***
	qbashi: 1. When writing synthetic documents, don't write anything if the calculated length is zero
			2. When generating synthetic words, we can't use & because it's a token breaker.  Use # instead.  (We could also use +)
	qbashq: 1. Output the original query too, when doing display_parsed_query.

*** v1.4.56 developer1 05 Nov 2015 ***
	qbashi: 1. Yet another go at the Zipf maths.  This time it's much better.
	
*** v1.4.57 developer1 12 Nov 2015 ***
	qbashi: 1. Increase the number of doh_blocks substantially when the x_bigger_trigger is set.
		
*** v1.4.58 developer1 13 Nov 2015 ***
	qbashq: 1. Remove a silly memory leak with substitution rules, caused by failing to call pcre2_match_data_free()
			2. Fix up an indirection error when printing default values of string valued arguments  (arg_parser.cpp)
					
*** v1.4.59 developer1 13 Nov 2015 ***
	qbashq-lib: 1. fflush stdout after loading indexes
				2. Don't generate an error exit if the config file isn't there.
									
*** v1.4.60 developer1 23 Nov 2015 ***  Tidying up some QBASHI options.
	qbashi: 1. Remove the x_fileorder_use_mmap option.  It's always FALSE.
			2. Change the default for x_use_vbyte_in_chunks to TRUE.
			3. Change the default for x_2postings_in_vocab to TRUE.
												
*** v1.4.61 developer1 24 Nov 2015 ***  
	qbashq: 1. In classification.cpp:classifier(), ifdef out the block of code which checks for ambiguous classification results
			2. In classification.cpp:term_match(), an error message: "Phrase within disjunction is too b______ complex!" was produced.
				- the test for complexity was too simple-minded anyway.
				- Add extra code to support phrases within disjunctions in classifier modes
				- Get rid of the complexity test and the b______ error message
			3. normalize_qtext() - fixed bug which removed quotes from within a disjunction.
			4. classifier_validate_settings() - fixed bug which set too tight a length limit when query contained operators
				- Introduced a query_has_operators BOOL in qex.  (QBASHQ.h)
																
*** v1.4.62 developer1 24 Nov 2015 ***  
	qbashq: 1. In classification.cpp:term_match(), an error message: "Disjunction within phrase is too b______ complex!" was produced.
				- the test for complexity was too simple-minded anyway.
				- Add extra code to support disjunctions within phrases in classifier modes
				- Get rid of the complexity test and the b______ error message
																				
*** v1.4.63 developer1 24 Nov 2015 ***  
	qbashq: 1. Fixing a SEGFAULT reported by Developer2.  In classification.cpp:term_match() the code must take
	           into account that elements of the dwds[] array may have been replaced by the index within 
			   the query of a term earlier in the query (cast as a (char *) pointer) which matched this term. 
			   If the code attempts to access the dwds[] element, a SEGFAULT will ensue.  Added tests 
			   to detect this and signal failure to match. 
																				
*** v1.4.64 developer1 25 Nov 2015 ***  
    qbashi: 1. Add a parameter to allow the variance of the term length distribution to be controlled.  
			   -x_synth_doc_length_stdev.  It's initialized to UNDEFINED_DOUBLE and set to half the 
			   mean, if not explicitly set. The values of mean and st.dev parameters are now printed
			   in the indexing log.  I confirmed that the values printed are appropriate when the 
			   stdev param is given and when it is not, and also that indexing completes normally and 
			   that the number of documents created with default stdev is what it used to be.  Haven't
			   checked what effect it has on the shape of the distribution.

			   I wonder if the distro should be lognormal rather than normal

*** v1.4.65 developer1 02 Dec 2015 ***  
    qbashi: 1. Reviewing and better documenting the code in getZipfianTermRandomNumber() and ifdeffing out
	           testing/debugging code
			2. Adding an option to allow explicit specification of the word probabilities of an aritrary 
			   number of head terms.   -x_head_term_percentages
			   
*** v1.4.66 developer1 02 Dec 2015 ***  
   qbashi: 1. Fixing glitch or two in synthetic term generation introduced in last edit.
			   
*** v1.4.67 developer1 03 Dec 2015 ***  PCRE2 out of memory issues.
   qbashq: 1. Imposing a tight limit on the length of an input subject string in apply_substitution_rules().  
	          If input is longer than this, no substitutions are attempted.  (Better than previous version
			  which arbitrarily truncated the input.)  The subject pattern can grow substantially as a result
			  of substitutions, and may eventually be truncated if a much higher length limit is exceeded.
			  			   
*** v1.4.68 developer1 03 Dec 2015 ***  Fix bug in stitching together explicitly specified head terms and zipf simulated middle section
   qbashi: 1. I prefer to regard it as a mathematical misunderstanding rather than a bug.  getZipfianTermRandomNumber now has an extra 
			  parameter F, the lowest valued term to be generated.  It moves the generation down the power law curve -- Important
			  because it's in linear space.
			  of substitutions, and may eventually be truncated if a much higher length limit is exceeded.
			  			   
*** v1.4.69 developer1 10 Dec 2015 ***  Addressing Developer2-reported bug triggered by -classifier_threshold=0.0
	qbashq:   It seems to be the case that the fundamental problem is related to memory allocation/freeing
		      caused when a query is or ends up empty.  
		   1. process_query_text() - test for empty query and return 0.  
		   2. process_query_text() - return query_word_count instead of 0 for non-error
		   3. handle_one_query() - return 0 if process_query_text() does
		   4. QBASHQ.cpp:thread_run_query() - Don't call free_results_memory() unless there is something to free.
		   			  			   
*** v1.4.70 developer1 10 Dec 2015 ***  Moderately serious memory leak when using substitutions.  
			ERROR: Memory grew too much (by 112.1MB), probable leak.  from qbash_substitution_rules_timing_check.pl
   qbashq: 1. Tighten up on all the exits from handle_one_query() -- there are quite a few -- to make sure
	          allocated memory has been free-ed before return.  No error now detected.
		   			  			   
*** v1.4.71 developer1 14 Dec 2015 ***  
   qbashi: 1. Avoid thread errors when indexing in file order with low max_docs.  Introduced a fourth state:
			  BUF_ABORT_READING.  Set the state of the next buffer to fill as that, and have the buffer filler
			  test for it.
		   			  			   
*** v1.4.72 developer1 14 Dec 2015 ***  
   qbashi:   Adding the capability (via -x_doc_length_histo=TRUE) to produce a histogram of document lengths
			 in QBASH.doclenhist -- Only applicable when index_dir is given
		   			  			   
*** v1.4.73 developer1 23 Dec 2015 ***  Trying to add the capability for quadratic modeling of the term freq distribution
	qbashi:  1. Add utils/erfi.cpp and utils/erfi.h, cut-down versions of open source libcerf.
			 2. Remove some useless code in utils/get_random_numbers.* and calls from QBASHI.cpp
			 3. Remove definitions of TERM_GEN_UNIFORM and TERM_GEN_APRX -- not used.  It's now either TERM_GEN_ZIPF 
				or TERM_GEN_OFF
			 4. Add x_zipf_gamma (even though it's Laherrere, not Zipf, when we use beta and gamma)
			 5. Partial implementation of getLaherrereTermRandomNumber()
			 6. A bit of plumbing work to get the alpha, beta and gamma values through to getLaherrereTermRandomNumber()
			    --- implementation incomplete ---
	dahash:  1. dahash tables were unnecessarily limited to 1 billion entries and that caused Bigrams_from_TSV to crash
	            on the tweets collection (near the end.)  Promoted capacity and entries_used to size_t from int and 
				(hopefully) made all the necessary changes.  In many cases the calculations were done in 64 bit 
				and there was a lot of unnecessary casting back and forth.  It seems as though things are behaving
				as they should.  The 1 billion limit which triggered the error exit was changed to 1 trillion.
						   			  			   
*** v1.4.74 developer1 29 Dec 2015 ***   Arranging to calculate and print mean and stdev of doc lengths in QBASHI when x_doc_length_histo=TRUE
	qbashi:  1. Modify write_doclen_histo() to calculate the mean and standard deviation:

						   			  			   
*** v1.4.75 developer1 30 Dec 2015 ***   
	qbashi:  Representing x_synth_postings and x_synth_vocab_size as doubles rather than uint64_ts for flexibility on input

							   			  			   
*** v1.4.76 developer1 31 Dec 2015 *** 
	qbashi:	1. Arrange for doclength mean and stdev are written when -x_doc_length_histo=TRUE even if the 
	           histo is not written to file.  Also initialise doclen_mean and doclen_stdev to zero just in case.
			   Finally, fix an off-by-one error in zero-ing the malloced histogram.
							   			  			   
*** v1.4.77 developer1 31 Dec 2015 *** 
	qbashi:	1. Fixing another glitch in -x_doc_length_histo=TRUE when index_dir == ZIPF-GENERATOR
								   			  			   
*** v1.4.78 developer1 31 Dec 2015 *** More tidy up.  
	qbashi:	1. In the ZIPF-GENERATOR case the QBASH.doclenhist is again written to "." like the
			   other index files.  (I'd forgotten that index_dir is set to "." in the ZIPF-GENERATOR case.)
			2. In calculate_k_table(), replace the annoying warning message about Chunk Table Overflow with 
			   a message conveying information about what's happening.  The special case handling would only
			   occur after seriously large numbers of postings.
		   								   			  			   
*** v1.4.79 developer1 31 Dec 2015 *** Version 1.4.77 crashed on redsar when generating > 1 billion ZIPF postings with doc_length_histo=TRUE
	qbashi: 1. Checked and tidied up various things.  Found small problem with non-ZIPF case but couldn't see anythihg wrong with ZIPF
		    2. Ran code analysis and fixed up a lot of small problems.   A lot of pointer errors are reported, despite that they are 
			   guarded :-(
			   		   								   			  			   
*** v1.4.80 developer1 *** Still tracking down the cause of the qbashi segfault.   NOW FIXED.
	qbashi: 1. Making sure that the doc_len_histo array is the size it ought to be.  It is.
		    2. Putting a few checks on the buffer size in convertTermNumberToWord()
			3. Aha!  rand_normal() called in process_fake_records() is capable of generating zero or
			   negative values.  They can lead to negative lengths, and the writing to beyond the  left
			   end of the doc_length_histo.  Put in a loop to discard lengths less than 1.
			   			   		   								   			  			   
*** v1.4.81 developer1 ***  Investigation of perturbations in emulated graph
	qbashi:	1. Added -x_zipf_generate_terms option to allow suppression of Developer2's term representation
	           algorithm in favour of numerical terms prefixed by h, m, or s, indicating how they
			   were generated:  head, middle or singleton.  Allows debugging of term generation. 
			   One look at the vocab.tsv provided the bulk of the explanation.

			   			   		   								   			  			   
*** v1.4.82 developer1 ***  Implementation of piecewise linear approximation of middle segment
	qbashi: 1. Add -x_zipf_middle_pieces option which allows the specification of segment descriptor
			   tuples. Tuples are terminated by a '%' and the five elements of a tuple are separated
			   by commas.  Tuple strings are parsed by setup_for_piecewise_linear() which exits on errors.
			   For each tuple an element of an array of midseg_desc_ts is initialised, including 
			   calculation of the derived variables necessary for getZipfianTermRandomNumber()
			2. If -x_zipf_middle_pieces is not used, then a single midseg_desc_t is setup.  In this
			   case the derived variables are calculated on the first call to getZipfianTermRandomNumber()
			3. drawHeadMiddleTailModifiedZipfTerm() now makes a top-level decision: head, middle, tail
			  to avoid going through unnecessary loops for head and middle.  Also, the random number
			  'which' which is used to make the selection is expanded in the right way and passed
			  to getZipfianTermRandomNumber() to avoid the need for the latter to call the random
			  number generator again.

*** v1.4.83 developer1 ***  Fixing up issues for Object Store usage
	qbashq-lib: 1. Fix bug in loading .substitution_rules and .global_idfs files - split_filelist_arg()
			    2. Allow caller to introduce temporary QBASHER options after TAB in query.
				3. A bunch of options to do with classification were marked as Immutable.  Change them 
				   to mutable to enable more flexible experimentation in Object Store.
				4. Change the config of QBASHCsharpNative to build its exe in x64/Debug so the DLLs are found.
				5. When unloading local_qoenv DON'T free substitution_rules and global_idfs unless you like
				   debugging SEGFAULTs


*** v1.4.84 developer1 ***  Changing the way classifier_segment works
	Until now, when a query matched the intent patterns defined for a segment, 1.0 was added to the match
	scores of all the responsive documents.  But the exact-match early termination rule meant that even a faintly 
	matching document scores more than 1.0 and causes early termination. 
	
*** v1.4.85 developer1 ***  Further improvements to classifier mode.
    Up until now, accepted candidates in classifier modes are not sorted.  In the case where max_candidates > max_to_show
	there may be high scoring results among the accepted candidates which are not shown to the user.   The obvious
	solution is to use a heap of max_to_show items to record (and order) only the top items.
	qbashq-lib: 1. 
 	
*** v1.4.86 developer1 ***  Trying to track down a memory corruption problem in the previous version QBASHQ
	- passed all the build tests but crashed randomly in classifier mode, on a particular combination of 
	  query set and lyrics index.
    1. Various small changes made but they didn't address the main problem
	2. handle_one_query() - make sure that max_candidates is one greater than max_to_show.  I haven't observed
	   any further crashes with this in place, but nor have I managed to find what part of the code is writing
	   one element beyond where it should.
 	
*** v1.4.87 developer1 ***  QBASHI: more detailed recording of option settings
	qbashi: 1. Implemented store_arg_values() in two versions one which includes experimental options and the other
		       doesn't
			2. Write non-experimental options into the .if header -- the full set is too long
			3. Write the full set of option settings on stdout.  (> index.log)
 	
*** v1.4.88 developer1 ***  Implementing better early termination controls for classifier modes
	qbashq: 1. Implement classifier_stop_thresh1 and classifier_stop_thresh2 (floats) arguments.
			   Stop as soon as a score higher than thresh1 is stored.  Note: it could be a relaxed result
			   Stop as soon as all slots in all result blocks are full and all of the stored scores are 
			   higher than thresh2.
			2. In the course of testing this, discovered what was wrong with the classifier() function in
			   classification.cpp.  Rewrote to assume that when relaxation_level > 0 all result blocks 
			   are sorted in descending score order and that the task is just to merge the lists until
			   max_to_show results have been stored
 	
*** v1.4.89 developer1 ***  Extra info in results
	qbashq: 1. Implement include_result_details option

*** v1.5.0 developer1 *** Increase header size, and include an idf field in .vocab
	qbashi:	1. Increase IF_HEADER_LEN and PAGESIZE from 1024 to 4096
			2. Change store_arg_values() call in Write_Inverted_File.cpp to store experimental options too.
			3. Major change in what's stored in .vocab file entries.  In both cases the length of the .vocab 
			   entries is 28 bytes.  In both cases, the first 16 bytes are used to store a null-terminated
			   string.  
			   
			   UP UNTIL NOW
			   the remaining bytes were used as follows:
			   4 bytes - occurrence count.  That's notenough for a 100B record collection
			   2 bytes - wasted
			   6 bytes - Either 5byte docno + 1 byte wpos (for a single posting)
			             Or 6 byte offset into .if file.

			  FROM NOW ON
			  5 bytes - occurrence count.  That's enough for a trillion occurrences
			  1 byte - quantized representation of IDF.
			  6 bytes - Either 5byte docno + 1 byte wpos (for a single posting)
			            Or 6 byte offset into .if file.

			  Is 1 byte enough to store sufficient IDF information?  Assuming IDF = log(N/n), where N is the 
			  number of records and n is the number of documents containing this term, then the maximum IDF
			  is log(N).  To make use of all the available values in an unsigned byte, we can multiply actual
			  IDF scores by C = 255 / log(N).  For a collection of 200M records (such as the current lyrics
			  index), C = 13.3411 and a term which occurs in only one record will achieve a quantized score 
			  of 255, while a term which occurs in two will score 246.  After divding those quantized scores
			  by C again, the values come out at 19.11 and 18.44 (compared with actual scores of 19.11 and 
			  18.42 respectively).  

		   4. Define vocabfile_entry_packer/unpacker functions in utility_nodeps.c plus a test function.
		   5. Define get_idf_from_quantized() and quantized_idf to work with to an arbitrary number of bits 
		      (between 1 and 32).  Also write a test function.
		   6. Change get_global_idf() to make use of the quantized idf from the .vocab file rather than 
		      the global_idfs file.
		   7. Removed all reference to the .global_idfs file from the QBASHQ code.
		   8. Make vocab_lister compatible with the new .vocab format (and promote various counters to 64 bit)

		   
*** v1.5.1 developer1 *** Fix bug in presenting extra columns in classifier results
	qbashq: 1. There were two bugs in utility_nodeps.c:extract_field_from_record() ... and there was no build 
				test of this. Now there is.
		   
*** v1.5.2 developer1 *** Ruggedize the code in load_substitution_rules()
	qbashq: 1. Flakey behaviour with respect to loading QBASH.substitution_rules_EN from an index_dir with a 
		       trailing slash was hard to debug.  Rewrote the code to:
			   a. Make it more stable
			   b. Avoid arbitrary limits on path lengths
			   c. Provide diagnostic output when debugging is requested.
			   		   
*** v1.5.3 developer1 *** Ressurect the capability to do simple Zipf term generation.
	qbashi: 1. Gather together all the generation parameter setting code in a function: set_up_for_term_generation()
			    - systematically deal with undefined option values
				- if alpha isn't defined call a new find_alpha() function to estimate it from N and |V|
					- if alpha estimation doesn't converge, the code complains and exits.
				- if no middle segments are explicitly defined, then we simulate a single one, calculating 
				  it's parameters from head and tail percentages and alpha.
				- There is a general problem with synthetic generation that it's easy to specify parameter combinations
				  that don't make sense, don't work, or cause a crash.  *** Not sure what to do about this ***
				- We need to write a lot more tests for various synthetic generation cases. -- one small step taken!

		    *** this version is a good step forward in terms of use of QBASHER as a benchmarking tool, however
			    considerably more work is needed on understanding the Zipf maths, leading to a more realistic
				version of find_alpha().   Two issues are that when you speciy parameters with N == |V|
				you don't get a uniform disribution, and you don't get a change in the tail percentage.
							   		   
*** v1.5.4 developer1 *** Starting to record quantized IDFs in the index.
	qbashi:    To avoid the need for a lot of extra memory during indexing and significant code changes
			   I decided to estimate the IDF as IDF = log(M * C / F), where F is the total occurrence frequency
			   for this term, M is the maximum occurrence freq./uency for any term and C is a constant to scale
			   things so that the minimum QIDF for any term is 1 and the maximum is 255.
			   Unfortunately, the Query Processor doesn't have access to the maximum occurrence frequency so
			   when converting the quantized IDF value back to an IDF, we have to use N the number of 
			   documents rather than M.
							   		   
*** v1.5.5 developer1 *** Actually fixed the problem finding the substitution_rules file (see 1.5.2 above)
	qbashq:

							   		   
*** v1.5.6 developer1 *** Before doing substitutions, replace Win-1252 punctuation with spaces.

*** v1.5.7 developer1 *** 
	qbashq:	1. emit substution error messages only when debugging

*** v1.5.8 developer1 *** Addressing problem of lyrics queries which should match but don't 
	qbashi: 1. Add '!' to set of token break characters
			2. Add an option "-expect_cp1252" to add all the Windows extended punctuation set to the token breaking set.
	qbashq: 3. Read the value of the expect_cp1252 option from the .if header and use it to decide whether to extend
	           the token breaking set.
			   
*** v1.5.9 developer1 *** Still there were problems with curly quotes in queries
	qbashq: 1. The whole normalisation of query text was a mess.  Tidied it up.
			2. Removed the normalize option - it wasn't being used.
			3. Fixed the computation of total_cost.  It had always been wrong.
			4. Fixed a bug in normalize_delimiters() which caused two adjacent phrases to amalgamate.
			   
*** v1.5.10 developer1 *** Optional extra feature output in classification mode
	qbashq:	1. New BOOL option:  include_extra_features
			2. If include_extra_features is set then 6 doubles are output with each result in classifier modes:
				Q - number of query terms (term = word, phrase, or disjunction)
				D - number of terms in document (I guess that's words or matched phrases - need to check)
				I - number of intervening words in the span of matched query words
				M - number of missing query words  in this candidate
				S - number of order swaps in the query words matched in this candidate
				static score.
				(Note that the numbers of words will be sums of IDFs in classifier modes 2 and 4)
			3. Various extra plumbing to facilitate this.

			   
*** v1.5.11 developer1 *** 
	qbashq:	1. Change zeta to omega (to allow for extra coefficients in relevance ranking) and remove it
		       from the rr_coeffs[] array.   It shouldn't be included in coefficient normalisation.
			   The reason for the name change is that we may eventually want to add more coefficients to the
			   relevance scoring formula.   Using Omega for classification makes all the earlier Greek
			   letters available:  zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi, omicron, pi, rho,
			   sigma, tau, upsilon, phi, chi, psi.
			2. In classification_score() test omega for zero before working out how to combine DOLM and
				static scores.  If omega == 0.0 the DOLM is represented in the first two digits of the
				decimal fraction and the static score in the less significant part.
			3. Add two more fields (Jaccard DOLM and DOLM) to the include_extra_features output.
			   
*** v1.5.12 developer1 *** Fix a long-standing bug in calculating the number of swaps S in the classification formula
	qbashq: 1. classification.cpp:classification_score()  - taking into account missing words, insertions and disjunctions with phrases etc.
				- it would be good to have a more comprehensive library of tests of this score calculation.
							   
*** v1.5.13 developer1 ***  Implementing the -x_batch_testing option (query on same line as results)
							   
*** v1.5.14 developer1 *** Fixing typo in implementation of -x_batch_testing option which caused garbage when a query in a batch had no answers.
							   
*** v1.5.15 developer1 *** 
	qbashq: 1. Change the classifier_score() formula for classifier_mode=1 to more heavily penalise missing query words -- add M * MWT to the denominator
			   instead of just M, where MWT is the penalty for a missed query term.  MWT = (6 - Q), with a minimum of 1.
			   This change was prompted by the query "Hello. Will I am".  The candidate 'Will I am' scored 0.75 while 'Will I am. Hello' scored only
			   0.66. Now the former scores only 0.5.
			2. Display op_counts and costs if -x_show_qtimes=TRUE.
									   
*** v1.5.16 developer1 *** 
	qbashq: 1. Introduce a classifier weighting coefficients chi and psi, to allow classifier scores to be a linear combination of 
			   lexical degree of match (weight chi), a score in 0 - 1 derived from record type (weight psi), and static score (weight omega).
	           The record-type score is derived from the extra_col field of the candidate record.  It is currently only used to promote matches 
			   on title, artist/title and title/artist over others -- If the field is "T", "AT", or "TA" the score of this feature 
			   is 1.0, otherwise it's zero.

*** v1.5.17 developer1 04 May 2016 *** 
	qbashi: 1. Implement utf8_getchar() function and unicode_ispunct() macro.  Note that if a leading byte is encountered which is in the
			   range 0x80 - 0xBF (illegal UTF-8) it is assumed that that byte is a Windows-1252 punctuation or symbol character, and 
			   it is converted to the Unicode equivalent.
			2. Use them in a mass of places in QBASHI.cpp to try to detect Unicode punctuation as token-breaking

				*** NOTE:  After implementing all this stuff in utility_nodeps.cpp, I discovered that there was already a UTF8.cpp 
				module in the Query Processor.  Functions in that module are never used.  It was last updated on 11 May 2015 -- I guess
				I stopped bothering when interest in deploying QBASHER lyrics service seemed to wane.

	qbashq: 1. In classification.cpp, make sure that matches to  a single word query are classified as AND or EXACT rather than SEQ or PHRASE.
			2. Remove "english" and "in english" from the lyrics segment tables in classification.cpp
			3. Add an extra column in classifier output (to the right), containing a count of the words in the query as actually processed.
			4. Use utf8_getchar 
			
*** v1.5.18 developer1 11 May 2016 *** 
	qbashq:   In edit 3 in the previous version, the number in the extra column was preceded by spaces.  That caused a problem with Steve's
			  consumer code.  This version elides leading spaces.
			  			
*** v1.5.19 developer1 17 May 2016 *** 
	qbashq: 1. Allow a .query_batch file to be specified in an object_store_files option.
			2. Make a mass of configuration setting changes (and a couple of changes to PCRE2 source) to allow QBASHQ and QBASHQsharpNative
			   to build for Release
			   			  			
*** v1.5.20 developer1 25 May 2016 ***  [[ Converting all solutions from VS2013 to VS2015]]
	qbashq:	1. Avoid error message if object_store_files argument includes consecutive commas.
			2. Fix up some errors (abs -> fabs) and warnings detected by VS 2015  (Similarly for qbashi)
			3. Allow a .output file to be specified in the object_store_files list
			4. Fix the "Query timeout count:"  at the end of a QBASHQ run.  (Uninitialised variable)
	QBASHQsharpNative  1. Substantial changes to allow queries to come from either a file or stdin.

*** v1.5.21 developer1 31 May 2016 ***  Implementing the ability to synthesize document lengths according to a gamma distribution rather than a Gaussian
	qbashi:	1. Options: x_synth_dl_gamma_shape, x_synth_dl_gamma_scale
		    2. Functions: rand_gamma() and test_rand_gamma()
			3. If x_synth_dl_gamma_shape is defined, Gamma will be used instead of Gaussian.
				
*** v1.5.22 developer1 16 Jun 2016 ***  Implementing the ability to synthesize document lengths according to piecewise segments
	qbashi: 1. Option: x_synth_dl_segments
			2. Function: rand_cumdist()
			3. if x_synth_dl_segments is defined, segments will be used instead of Gamma or Gaussian.
							
*** v1.5.23 developer1 23 Jun 2016 ***  Tracking down a segfault when simulating ClueWeb12Titles using dlsegs
	qbashi: 1. drawHeadMiddleTailModifiedZipfTerm() allow for the possibility that expanded_r maybe equal to -0.0, thus avoiding very infrequent
	           error messages.
			2. Print doc count and vocab size at the end of the document scan
			3. Write the document length histogram at the end of the document scan
			4. Fix a couple of errors in what's printed out by doh_print_usage_report()
			5. Double the size of MAX_VALSTRING in arg_parser.h to reduce chance of truncation of long arg strings.
			6. Increase the size of string buffer used in print_version_and_option_settings() to reduce chance of truncation.
			7. Print a message for every 10 million documents scanned in doc synthesis.
			8. Implement the test_rand_cumdist() function.  (It passed.)
			9. Print a message for every 100 thousand terms processed in write_inverted_file()
										
*** v1.5.24 developer1 24 Jun 2016 ***  
	qbashi:	1. Edit 1 in 1.5.23 went a little far and caused error exits.  Backing off.  (SEGFAULT on clueWeb12Titles no
	           longer occurs.)
			   										
*** v1.5.25 developer1 24 Jun 2016 ***  
	qbashi	1. Converting real-valued lengths to integers should use ceil() for the piecewise method, rather than
			   round().
			2. The rand_gamma() function neglected to save alpha to last_alpha, costing a little in efficiency.
						   										
*** v1.5.26 developer1 27 Jun 2016 ***  Significant changes to document length modeling
	qbashi	1. Adding utils/dynamic_arrays module
			2. Refactoring so that document lengths are selected from an in-memory dynamic-array 
			   histogram.  dlgamma, dlnormal, dlsegs now generate the histogram prior to fake_doc_scan.
			3. Added x_synth_dl_read_histo option to allow a document length histogram to be read from
			   an existing doclenhist file.
						   										
*** v1.5.27 developer1 01 Jul 2016 ***  Synthesized collections don't write out .doctable when they should.
	qbashi	1. Writing out a doctable entry with some bogus entries like score and doc signature -- 
			      maybe we should fix the latter.
			2. process_fake_records() now returns a correct value for infilesize
			3. The qbash_synthetic_check.pl build tests have been enhanced to create a known-item query
			   and run it over the on-the-fly synthesized indexes.  -debug=3 is used to make QBASHQ conduct
			   tests on the indexes prior to running the query.
						   										
*** v1.5.28 developer1 05 Jul 2016 ***  Not sure that anything was changed

*** v1.5.29 developer1 09 Jul 2016 ***  
	qbashi	1. Increase MAX_LINE to 1 million when -x_bigger_trigger is set. Otherwise (in file order indexing
	           only) some words in very long documents won't be indexed.

*** v1.5.30 developer1 11 Jul 2016 ***  WT10g documents can be megabytes long
	qbashi	1. Increase IBM_IOBUFSIZE to 10MB from 1  (formerly known just as IOBUFSIZE)
	`       2. Increase MAX_LINE to 10 million and words_indexed_per_document to 200k in the bigger_trigger case.
	
*** v1.5.31 developer1 12 Jul 2016 ***  By default, don't allow per-query options. At request of Stevenga
	qbashq  1. -allow_per_query_options option and qoenv member.  FALSE by default.
			2. In three places, strip tabs unless this option is set.
	
*** v1.5.32 developer1 14 Jul 2016 ***  Reduce risk of crashes if per-query-options are allowed and rubbish is included
    qbashq	1. The loops for parsing out per-query options in handle_one_query() tried to allow for quoted arguments
	           but didn't handle the case of unbalanced quotes (e.g. apostrophes).  That led to segfaults in queries
			   which had a TAB followed by an unbalanced quote.  For now, removed the quote-handling altogether.  Any
			   per-query options shouldn't be quoted.
	
*** v1.5.33 developer1 14 Jul 2016 ***  
	qbashi	1. Add caveat to message for max_line_prefix_postings option.
			
*** v1.5.34 developer1 24 Aug 2016 ***   *** Debugging production segfault ***
        qbashq  1. Found a spurious statement in term_match() function at line 525 in classification.cpp
                        //*q = qsave;  // This was the cause of production crashes 24 Aug 2016
                2. Added a remove_possessives parameter to normalize_qtext() in qbashq-lib.cppp
                3. Possible future belts and braces.  In any non-zero classifier_mode: at line 3413 in qbashq-lib.cpp
                        // New as of 24 Aug 2016 (in response to production crashes)

    GIT change

*** v1.5.50A developer1 26 Aug 2016 ***   *** Another segfault in
    OS lyrics production, and a memory leak ***
    (A) indicates changes applied to version 1.5.34A in TFS
    qbashq  1. Implemented a simpler and more draconian input cleaner:
	       trim_and_strip_all_ascii_punctuation_and_controls()
 	    2. Call it from around line 3456 of qbashq-lib.cpp

*** v1.5.51 developer1 29 Aug 2016 ***   *** A segfault uncovered by
    fuzz queries. ***
       qbashq: 1. normalize_delimiters() didn't correctly handle the
                  removal of double quotes.  Major rewrite.
 	    2. Call it from around line 3456 of qbashq-lib.cpp
	    -- This fix NOT applied to the TFS version or installed in
	    -- OS lyrics production because calssifier_modes remove
	    -- all punctuation.

*** v1.5.52 developer1 05 Sep 2016 ***  *** Addressing Wunderlist issues ***
       qbashq: 1. Hundreds of minor changes to ensure compilation
                  succeeds with gcc -Wall
	       2. Add 0777 mode to files created with open_w()
       

*** v1.5.53 developer1 05 Sep 2016 ***  *** Making VS projects/solutions
                                          for all the programs***
       Only three immediate problems:
         1. QBASHQ.exe built by VS under GIT seems to be 3.5 times slower than
            the one built by VS from the TFS sources.
	 2. QBASHQsharpNative reports errors when run from the build
            tests.
	 3. Times and QPS values are not being reported in the GCC
            version		  
       
*** v1.5.54 developer1 06 Sep 2016 ***  *** Getting QBASHsharpNative
                                          to work ***
	 1. Changes to the project definitions to include and
            reference the libraries
	 2. Fix up single-threaded path in main loop in QBASHQ.c
	    so that it records and reports latency and QPS numbers
       
*** v1.5.54 developer1 06 Sep 2016 *** Fixing QBASHI segfault on
                                     GCC file-order indexing
	 1. The code in write_inverted_file() to handle the
            non-threaded wasn't actually written.  It is now.
	 2. Improved the Makefile.
	 3. Added O_TRUNC to the open options in open_w() - otherwise
            length of .vocab was wrong.
        
*** v1.5.55 developer1 07 Sep 2016 *** Tracking why GIT /VS2015 version
                                     is slower than TFS/VS2015
	 1. Avoiding the exit when warm_indexes=true is given.
	 2. Make sure inthebeginning timer is started just before
	    running a query batch - after any warm up
	 3. Aha!  Removing the temporary statement which set
            query_streams to 1
	 4. QBASHI: Reinserting some statements which got lost from
	    process_records_in_file_order() -- to calculate the size
	    of the .forward file.  Result was that the number of
	    lines was estimated to be zero, and indexing failed
            because the DOH wasn't large enough.
	 5. QBASHQ: Forgot to document previously that -warm_indexes
	    no longer causes QBASHQ to exit.  Warm_indexes can be
            combined with other options.  That means that
            output_statistics should not be set to false on the
	    presence of this option.

*** v1.5.56 developer1 07 Sep 2016 *** Adding GCC threading to QBASHQ
	1. Unfortunately performance is very poor

*** v1.5.57 developer1 16 Sep 2016 *** Chasing a fleeting segfault (classifier + relaxation)
	1. Increase the maximum length of input string to apply_substitution_rules_to_string() 
	   to 256 and the maximum output length to MAX_RESULT_LEN.
	2. Change classifier_mode section of possibly_record_candidate() to
	   use dc_copy (lowercased, and substituted) rather than going back to
	   the original.  More efficient and reduces demand on stack memory
	3. Fix error in calculation of I in classification_score() - Note that 
	   this required some minor changes in qbash_classifier_modes_test.pl
	4. Explicitly initialise all the local variables in classification_score(),
	   possibly_store_in_order() and possibly_record_candidate()
	5. Checked code in possibly_record_candidate(), possibly_store_in_order() 
	   and classification_score()

*** v1.5.58 developer1 19 Sep 2016 *** Complete rewrite of Windows threadpool use
    as per Implementing a simple worker farm with a Windows threadpool - Dave OneNote
	1. Also changed things so that query_streams=1 causes the unthreaded code to run
	   (necessary to run tests involving debug=1 output because that isn't synced.)

*** v1.5.59 developer1 19 Sep 2016 *** Finally (hopefully) nailing the fleeting
    segfault.
	I noticed that one of the thresh2 tests in qbash_classifier_modes_check.pl
	was failing on redsar with the multi-threaded version (only).  Tracing that
	to use of uninitialised memory (the elements of the candidatesa array) was
	pretty easy.  Adding a memset() fixed that and seems (250+ runs
	so far completed) to have fixed the segfault problem.  Unsure why the 
	uninitialisation problem did not ever manifest itself on my laptop or 
	in single-threaded mode on redsar, and why it so rarely caused problems
	even in multi-threaded mode on redsar.

*** v1.5.60 developer1 19 Sep 2016 *** But the new threading model
	has a memory leak.  Running the 92 million query set showed that
	QBASHQ memory (as reported by TaskManager) grew from 1.6MB to 58GB 
	after only a few million queries processes, and the system started 
	labouring badly.  An attempt to fix this by removing the stuff to do
	with cleanup groups caused other problems.
	-- Reverted to the old (v1.5.57) QBASHQ.c.  That avoids the segfault 
	AND the memory leak.  Build tests passed.

*** v1.5.61 developer1 31 Oct 2016 *** Addressing bugs found by David Maxwell
	1. QBASHQ:  [Aside] Fix bug in what2show() function l++ should have been l-- 
	   in stripping trailing spaces
    2. QBASHQ:  Fix bug in what2show() function, loop to suppress multiple spaces.
	   problem was that loop termination depended upon what2show + l, but 
	   l was reduced when spaces were suppressed.

*** v1.5.62 developer1 02 Dec 2016 *** Adding a capability to generate a
    	JO (Joint Optimisation, aka CAL, Combined Alteration
    	service) path in cases where no intent word is present but
	we are confident of the intent.
	1. QBASHQ:  Add generate_JO_path option and variable.
	2. classifier.c:code_flags_and_terms_which_matched() modified
    	to  implement this.

*** v1.5.63 developer1 16 Dec 2016 *** Just adding some Unicode / UTF-8
        functions and splitting them all into a new shared module.
	Currently only the initialisation function is called from
	QBASHI and QBASHQ_LIB.  Other functions are not yet used.
	    
*** v1.5.64 developer1 19 Dec 2016 *** Starting the process of becoming
        more Unicode respectful.
	1. QBASHI.  Option is now case_fold rather than
        ascii_case_fold and when true, utf8_lower_case() is called
	rather than byte-by-byte ASCII folding.
	2. QBASHI:process_trigger() - Make handling of line-prefix
	indexing UTF-8 aware.
	3. unicode.c: get


	**TODO** Write test of line prefix indexing for UTF-8 word start.
	
*** v1.5.65 developer1 23 Dec 2016 *** Providing command line users with
       more explanation of errors in command line options, while not
       changing the output when run from Object Store.

*** v1.5.66 developer1 29 Dec 2016 *** Fixing up implementation of
    "bigger triggers" in QBASHI.
       1. Print limits on text indexed to log, with or without
          bigger_trigger
       2. When combining bigger_trigger with file-order scanning,
          the line buffer is too big for the stack.  Malloc it
	  and free at the end of the function.
       
*** v1.5.67 developer1 04 Jan 2017 *** Fixed a couple of bugs in dealing
    with UTF-8 line prefixes in QBASHI.c:process_trigger() while
    trying to track down a discrepancy in total word occurrence count
    v. total of doclen histogram.
       
*** v1.5.68 developer1 05 Jan 2017 *** For some reason, ASCII control
    chars were showing up in vocab.tsv.  It turned out to be because
    of the presence of characters outside the Basic MultiLingual
    Plane (BMP).  The functions to convert UTF-8 strings to lower case
    and to remove accents, just masked the UCS code down to the BMP
    bits and looked up the unicode tables.  That's obviously
    incorrect,  and they now just pass through non-BMP characters.
    
*** v1.5.69 developer1 17 Jan 2017 *** Overhaul to completely remove
    use of ASCII lower casing from the entire suite.  Lower casing is
    now done using the functions in unicode.c.
    2. Several places where a finite state machine has been
    implemented inline to split a string (document, query) into an
    array of words, have been replaced by calls to
    utf8_split_line_into_null_terminated_words()
    
*** v1.5.70 developer1 18 Jan 2017 *** Accent conflation
    1. QBASHQ - added -x_conflate_accents option, to get the accent
       removal machinery working, in case we need it.
    2. QBASHQ - Added a conditional call to utf8_remove_accents() after
       each call to utf8_lowering_copy()
    3. QBASHI - Implemented the functionality behind the
    -conflate_accents option, by making process_a_word() a front-end
    to process_a_word_internal(). Process_a_word() can now potentially
    index multiple variants of a word.  If accent conflation is
    specified, and the word to be indexed has accents, those accents
    are removed and process_a_word_internal() called a second time.  
    3. Added quite a few tests to ../scripts/qbash_utf8_check.pl

    **** Note:  With the VS-compiled version of QBASHQ, it isn't
    **** possible to enter accented words via -pq= because the runtime
    **** library forces everything to ASCII and shows accented letters
    **** as some sort of undefined symbol.  If I declared argv as
    **** TCHAR * then I could read the characters as UTF-16, but then
    **** I'd have to convert them to UTF-8 and it probably wouldn't
    **** work with GCC.   I've told VS I want to use multi-byte
    **** characters, why doesn't it leave the command line bytes
    **** alone??????!!!!!   
    
*** v1.5.71 developer1 02 Feb 2017 *** Show result counts when
    max_to_show==0  (For emulation of Bhatia et al method.)
    1. QBASHQ - Extend value range for max_to_show option to include
       zero
    2. QBASHQ - Introduce qoenv->report_match_counts_only and
       qex->full_match_count to implement the special behaviour
    3. QBASHQ - Don't call possibly_record_match() in this mode,
       just increment qex->full_match_count
    4. QBASHQ - when max_to_show == 0, set max_candidates_to_consider
       to a BILLION_AND_ONE
    5. QBASHQ - Avoid allocating and freeing results memory when
       qoenv->report_match_counts_only is set.
    6. QBASHQ.c - Special output mode in partial query case
    7. QBASHQ - Special output mode in present_results()
    
    **** IMPORTANT CAVEATS ****
    1. This capability is so far only implemented to cover the
       case of simple query modes.  Avoid using it in conjunction
       with classifier modes, relaxation, partial words etc.
    2. I've noticed some discrepancies between the counts returned in this
       mode and those returned by 'grep "\b<word>\b"  ...../QBASH.forward.
       In some cases the counts are equal but in quite a few others
       they'e not.  E.g.
       Word	    GREP      QB
       barack       6117    6117  =
       obama       71969   71961  >
       wolf        34048   34051  <
       quokka         43      43  =
       aardvark      478     478  =
       bogans         28      28  =
       bogan         273     273  =
       plantain      508     508  = 
       Hopefully, this is just due to minor differences in
       tokenization.  
  
*** v1.5.72 developer1 20 Feb 2017 *** Avoid indexing documents with
    zero indexable words.
    1. QBASHI.c: Add a test for empty document to
    process_records_in_score_order() and process_records_in_file_order()
    2. Also mods in process_trigger() to avoid counting zero length
    docs
    
*** v1.5.73 developer1 16 Mar 2017 *** Correct minor glitches in word
    definition in QBASHI.c:process_trigger() - basically changing to
    match the code in
    utf8_split_line_into_null_terminated_words(). The motivation to do
    this came from the observation that some "words" in QBASH.vocab
    included spaces.    
    1. Call utf8_getchar() for any character with a leading one bit.
       That allows for handling of Windows CP-1252 punctuation.
    
*** v1.5.74 developer1 24 Mar 2017 *** Arranging a display_col variant
    which identifies a doc by it offset in the .forward file
    Use -display_col=-1.  Output will be Off1234 etc plus score.
    
*** v1.5.75 developer1 27 Mar 2017 *** Preliminary implementation of
    BM25 scoring.
    1. QBASHQ: Added idf member to saat_control_t.  It's set in setup_word_node()
    2. QBASHQ: Added N and avdoclen members to query_processing_environment_t.
       Initialise them to UNDEFINED_DOUBLE
    3. QBASHI: Write "Total postings", "Number of documents", and
       "Vocabulary size" lines into the .if  header.
    4. QBASHQ: Set N and avdoclen in check_if_header()
    
*** v1.5.76 developer1 31 Mar 2017 *** Increasing the precision of the
    average query latency when displayed in query batch mode.
    (Necessitated a change to a pattern in qbash_utf8_check.pl)
    
*** v1.5.77 developer1 02 Apr 2017 *** Fixing a problem in the
    QBASHQ_lib.c code for checking that repeated query terms
    are repeated sufficiently often in the document.  The problem
    arises with x_bigger_trigger indexes, in which word position
    254 is repeated for all the words from position 254 on.
    Unfortunately the repetition test relies on word positions.
    Interim solution is to abandon the repetition testing as soon as a
    position >= 254 is encountered.  I.e. repetitions will be
    enforced up to the first 254 words of the document but testing
    will be abandoned if the right number of repetitions are not
    found within the firest 255 words.  Not a very satisfying
    solution.
    
*** v1.5.78 developer1 24 Apr 2017 *** Adding basic geospatial
    capability.  If this capability is being used, the .forward
    file is assumed to contain the following columns:
       1. address text
       2. static score
       3. object ID
       4. lat long
    In this situation, QBASHI indexes special words indicating the
    tiles in which a point of interest or business is located.
    Overlapping tiles are used, so that each point is indexed
    with two latitude special words and two longitude special
    words.  e.g. x$96 x$97 y$12 y$13.  Latitude special words
    are indexed at position 250 in the document and longitude ones
    at position 2511, so that "lat long" phrase query terms can be
    processed.

    In terms of query matching, there is no change to QBASHQ. If a
    query contains special words then they are processed just like any
    other words.  However, in the future we will introduce a scoring
    system based on calculating the distance between a query location
    and the candidate location.  Distance scores will be able to be
    combined with static and textual match scores to come up with an
    appropriate local search ranking.

    The aim of all the above is to enable sufficiently fast
    autosuggest for local search applications.  The tile words allow
    selection of a candidate set sufficiently small to enable
    low-latency operation of QBASHER partial word matching.

    Changes:

    1. Introduce utils/latlong.[ch] to contain the functions for
       tile calculation and eventually distance score calculation.
    2. Add x_geo_tiles option to QBASHI.  It's integer value
       determines the number of tiles in each of vertical and
       horizontal directions.  If zero, lat-long capability is
       disabled.  If lat-long is active, and a document has no
       valid lat-long data, then special words x$none and y$none will
       be indexed.  
       
*** v1.5.79 developer1 05 May 2017 *** Providing the ability to
    suppress excess QBASHQ output, when queries come from a
    batchfile.  This was motivated by the combination of several
    things:
	a. Developer2 couldn't get the gcc-compiled version of QBASHQ.exe to
           run under IIS.
	b. The VS-2015 compiled version of QBASHQ.exe garbles UTF-8 command
           line parameters - multibyte characters are received as a
           single byte.  Therefore submitting a non-English query via
	   a pq= parameter is not viable -- it's not good even under
    	   gcc anyway because characters like $ must be quoted.
	c. Entering queries via a file_query_batch= file generates
	   a mass of unnecessary output which mucks up Developer2's
    JavaScript.
    
*** v1.5.80 developer1 05 May 2017 *** using geo distances
    1. utils/latlong.c:greatCircleDistance() and geoScore()
    2. Added -eta= to set of ranking features (geo distance)
    3. Added -lat= and -long= to set the origin for a search
    4. Modified score() to allow for eta and geoScore()
    
*** v1.5.81 developer1 08 May 2017 *** Fix a bug in auto_line_prefix
    and auto_partials.   The normalize_delimiters() call before them
    removed trailing spaces.
    
*** v1.5.82 developer1 08 May 2017 *** Prevent people from setting a
    zero value for max_line_prefix_postings (when line-prefixes are
    being used).

*** v1.5.83 developer1 08 May 2017 *** Investigating a segfault during
    extraction of document features in the score() function.  It
    turned out to occur when line_prefixes were being indexed.  Each
    invisible word, such as '>c' added to the count of words in the
    document, but it shouldn't have.
    
*** v1.5.84 developer1 09 May 2017 ***
    apply_substitution_rules_to_string() used to refuse to perform
    substitutions if the string contained a square bracket, but that
    disabled substitutions when disjunctions of geo-tile words were
    prepended in Local Search autosuggest.   Now, we skip to the last
    closing square bracket and do the testing / substitution after
    that.  SHould probably test for " as well as [

*** v1.5.85 developer1 09 May 2017 ***  Tracking down NaNs in
    distance scoring.  Turned out to be because of some error
    in my maths which can sometimes cause the calculated straight line
    distance between two points to exceed the diameter of the earth
    which used to be impossible.  Inserted a post hoc fixup.
    
*** v1.5.86 developer1 10 May 2017 ***  Fix bug introduced in 1.5.84.
    Problem was that the section of a query up to the last ']' was not
    copied across.

*** v1.5.87 developer1 12 May 2017 *** Extend the x_geo_tiles mechanism
    to cater for lat,long,lang in column 4 of the TSV file.  Lang is
    represented by a special word such as l$DE.  We put that in
    column 4 rather than column 1 so as to avoid it ever showing up
    in summaries or responding to partials or rank-only terms, or to
    participate in the Bloom filter.
    
*** v1.5.88 developer1 15 May 2017 *** Removing an efficiency condition
    in matching of partial words which caused valid answers in the 
    local search demo to be missed, when the matching record was very
    short and the query had been expanded by geo-tile and language
    special words.
    
*** v1.5.89 developer1 15 May 2017 *** Allowing the imposition of a
    threshold on the span length of a match for a query including
    word-prefixes.  (Again for the local search demo.)  For the
    query {ormond s}, the span length for "Ormond Street" would be
    zero (no intervening non-matched words).  However the span length
    for "Ormond Ct Jerrabomberra 2619 New South Wales Australia" would
    be 4 -- Ct, Jerrabomberra, 2619, and New are intervening words.
    1. New QBASHQ option: -max_span_length.
    
*** v1.5.90 developer1 17 May 2017 *** Various improvements:
    1. Deal with a serious problem with utf8_getchar() - If we do the
    translation from CP-1252 characters to Unicode within a
    copy-in-place scenario there is an inevitable length
    increase.  This can cause infinite looping in
    e.g. utf8_lower_case(). Added a BOOL param.
    2. Removed qbashq-lib/UTF8.[ch] - not used, superceded
    3. Removed some code in qbashq-lib/classification.c which
    had long ago been superceded by utf8_split_string_into_words()
    4. Changed the definition of duplicate_handling to avoid excessive
    collapse of the results set.  The previous behaviour (compare each
    result in the set of max_to_show with all the previous ones) can
    potentially result in only one result displayed. That checking is
    now only done if duplicate_handling == 2.  When duplicate_handling
    == 1, a duplicate check between adjacent items in the score
    ranking is performed in rerank_and_record().  Provided
    max_candidates is higher than max_to_show, this may solve the
    collapse problem.  duplicate_handling==2 causes both types of
    checks to be performed.
    5. Had to modify qbash_sanity_check.pl to set duplicate_handling=2
    6. Added -theta= coefficient to allow weighting of the intervening
    words feature.  *** Only when query involves one or more partials,
    at this stage ***
    
*** v1.5.91 developer1 19 May 2017 *** Changes to adapt to new
    geo-tiling method used in utils/latlong.c.
    1. Six words are now indexed rather than four
    2. The option is now -x_geo_tile_width rather than -x_geo_tiles
    and it's value is a float rather than an int
    
*** v1.5.92 developer1 21 May 2017 *** Implement the ability to
    filter by geo-radius
    1. QBASHQ - new option -geo_filter_radius
    2. Updated ../scripts/qbash_geo_tiles_check.pl
    
*** v1.5.93 developer1 21 May 2017 *** When geo-indexing, allow for
    bigger tiles as well.
    1. QBASHI option - -x_geo_big_tile_factor:  When non-zero also
    index tiles which are this factor bigger than the normal ones.
    
*** v1.5.94 developer1 26 June 2017 *** Remove synthetic corpus stuff
    from QBASHI in the interests of greater maintainability.
    
*** v1.5.95 developer1 12 July 2017 *** Implementing support for
    multi-queries.
    1. Replace handle_query_plus_options() with handle_multi_query()
    2. Change present_results() to expect combined rather than
       separate queries + options.
    3. Change -max_to_show and -max_candidates to be immutable options
       so that we can allocate storage once only per multi-query.
       (Immutable within a multi-query would be better.)
    4. Define ASCII_RS (0x1E) as an additional record separator.
    5. Define find_nth_occurrence_in_record() in utility_nodeps.h
    6. Change one or two of the build tests to accomodate change 3
       above
    7. Teeth pulling to fix all the damage caused by above changes.
       Thank goodness for the build tests.
    8. Plumbing through the query weight to handle_one_query(),
       process_query() and rerank_and_record().
    9. Ditto for classifier()
   10. New build test: qbash_multi_query_check.pl
    
*** v1.5.96 developer1 12 July 2017 *** RHS of substitution rules must
    be lower-cased otherwise modified query can't match anything.
    1. shared/substitutions.c:load_substitution_rules() - replace
       memcpy() with utf8_lowering_copy()
    2. Updated
    ../QBASHER/indexes/AS_top500k/QBASH.substitution_rules_EN to
       include uppercase rules
    3. Updated ../scripts/qbash_substitution_rules_check.pl to
       test the upper case rule.  (It failed before the change in
       1 above.

*** v1.5.97 developer1 13 July 2017 *** Introduction of a candidate
       generation query - to allow a shorter query for candidate
       generation while retaining the query_as_processed for
       scoring.
    1. Add candidate_generation_query, cg_qterms, and cg_qwd_count
       to the book_keeping structure
    2. Define create_candidate_generation_query(qoenv, qex) -- As
       an interim measure just copy qterms over to cg_qterms
       and qwd_cnt to cg_qwd_cnt
    3. Call saat_setup() with cg_qterms and cg_qwd_count
    4. Change defn of saat_relaxed_and() to only pass qex and not
       a bunch of individual members.  Make it use the cg_ versions
       of qwd_cnt and qterms.  (Passes all the GCC LITE build tests)
    5. Change defn of possibly_record_candidate() in similar fashion.
       (Passes all the GCC LITE build tests)
    6. Split create_candidate_generation_query(qoenv, qex) off into
       separate query_shortening.[ch] module
    7. Introduce query_shortening_threshold= parameter
    8. Implement a query shortening algorithm
    9. Populate qex->candidate_generation_query and show it when
       display_parsed_query is set.
   10. Change the system for setting term_matched bits (in
       classification_score()) so that they correspond to the
       query_as_processed rather than to the
       candidate_generation_query .
   11. Implement ../scripts/qbash_query_shortening_check.pl
   
*** v1.5.98 developer1 14 July 2017 *** Query shortening algo in the
    previous version didn't work the way I wanted.  Rewrote it.
    +  Fixes to a couple of recent build tests
    +  Annoyance with qsort_r() v. qsort_s() in query_shortening.c
    
*** v1.5.99 developer1 19 July 2017 *** Reviewing exit()s which
    might be called during query processor.
    1. Adding comments to indicate the ones which are indexer only
       or called only in debugging mode
    2. Changed several malloc calls to cmalloc() to avoid repeated tests for
       malloc() fails
    3. In qbashq-lib/classification.c:classifier_score() removed the
       exit call when dwds_cnt values disagreed.  (This actually
       happened when using QBASHQ 1.5.98 on a very old 1.5 index.)
       Now we continue on.
     
*** v1.5.100 developer1 24 July 2017 *** Change the IDF for a
    non-occurring term from a constant 3.0 to log(N), the same
    as a term which occurs only once.  For a large corpus, a
    value of 3 doesn't seem to reflect the desired importance of a
    missing non-occurring term in classifier modes which use
    IDFs.
     
*** v1.5.101 developer1 17 August 2017 *** Removing superfluous
    options in the interests of maintainability.
    QBASHQ:
    1. Remove allow_prefixes option
    2. Remove drop_unknown_words option
    3. Remove special_matching modes
    4. Remove saat_and() function and code which calls it.
    5. Modified build tests which made use of deleted options.

*** v1.5.102 developer1 17 August 2017 *** Continuing the removal.
    These may be more complex ...
    QBASHQ
    1. Remove relaxation_mode option and code which supports it.
    2. Remove sub_queries_to_include option and code which supports it.
    3. Remove sub_queries_to_exclude option and code which supports
       it.
    4. Also removed last vestiges of exception_strings (which have
       never been used in QBASHER applications.)
    5. Modified build tests which made use of deleted options (lots!).
    6. Removed add_relaxtion_options_to_test_queries from GIT
    7. Qsplitter modified to print message requiring code modification
       to remove dependence on sub_query_includes
  
*** v1.5.103 developer1 22 August 2017 *** Adding street number
    processing capabilities
    QBASHQ
    1. Add utils/street_addresses.[ch]
    2. Add street_number_processing option and variables.
    3. Add street_specs_col option and variables
    4. Implement street number validity checking
    
*** v1.5.104 developer1 24 August 2017 ***  Adding abililty to
    remove +4 part of ZIP5+4.  E.g. 90210-3456 -> 90210. Also
    allow for house numbers starting with #
    QBASHQ
    1. Add strip_zips function to utils/street_addresses.[ch]
    
*** v1.5.105 developer1 24 August 2017 ***  Expanding the definition
    of the unicode_ispunct macro to include a few more punctuation
    ranges.  *** Still not complete.  Should probably read the
    UnicodeData.txt file and declare all the letters and digits
    (only) to be indexable.
    
*** v1.5.106 developer1 24 August 2017 *** Adding epsilon more
    sophistication to the street address stuff.
    1. Stripping "apt BLAH" and "apartment BLAH" as well as suite BLAH
       and unit BLAH.
    2. Dealing with a range of house numbers, e.g. 40-60 BLAH street.
    3. Allowing for street number suffixes such as bis, and A or B
    
*** v1.5.107 developer1 28 August 2017 *** Fixing a bug affecting
    queries containing a word X which is repeated within a subsequent
    disjunction.
    QBASHQ
    1. Fixed bugs in SAAT_DISJUNCTION branch of
       saat_advance_within_doc()
    2. Beefed up qbash_disjunction_check.pl
       *** Note: Still won't work when it's a phrase appearing both as a
       top level term in the query and within a disjunction.
       
*** v1.5.108 developer1 28 August 2017 *** Trying to extend the
    improvement in 1.5.107 to phrases within disjunctions.
    QBASHQ
    1. Solved using a peek-ahead function for phrases
    *** Note we still don't have a test for repeated phrases
    outside disjunctions.
    2. Beefed up qbash_disjunction_check.pl
    
*** v1.5.109 developer1 29 August 2017 *** Addressing the problem
    with repeated phrases outside disjunctions.
    QBASHQ
    1. Used leaf_peek_ahead_in_same_doc()
    2. Beefed up qbash_disjunction_check.pl	
    *** Note we still don't have code to deal with disjunctions
    in phrases -- Where will all this end??
    
*** v1.5.110 developer1 30 August 2017 *** Addressing the problem
    with repeated disjunctions within phrases.
    QBASHQ
    1. Used disjunction_peek_ahead_in_same_doc()
    2. Again beefed up qbash_disjunction_check.pl
    
*** v1.5.111 developer1 30 August 2017 *** Trivial change to allow
    for an 'n' in front of a street number.
    1. In utils/street_addresses.c
    2. Added a couple of tests to qbash_street_addresses.pl
    
*** v1.5.112 developer1 10 October 2017 *** Allowing results from
    multiple query variants to co-exist within a result set.
    Up until now, the result counters were zeroed prior to execution
    of second and subsequent queries.
    1. Added a candidates_recorded array to the book_keeping structure
    2. Modified load and unload bookkeeping to malloc and free it.
     -- Actually, there were a lot of changes required to achieve
     -- this goal
    3. Added a couple of tests to qbash_multi_query_check.pl
    4. All the LITE tests pass.

*** v1.5.113 developer1 18 October 2017 *** Triggering an Easter Egg
    1. Added a simple regex matcher re_match() to substitutions.c
    2. Defined an EASTER_EGG_PATTERN (currently case-insensitive
       "^gonebut notforgotten$")
    3. Called re_match() at the head of handle_one_query to test
       query string for EASTER_EGG_PATTERN.  If test succeeds, a
       single result is returned, giving QBASHER version number and
       number of documents in the index.
       
*** v1.5.114 developer1 24 October 2017 ***  Implementing a timeout
       based on elapsed msec.
    1. Added -timeout_msec option
    2. Added start_time member to book_keeping_for_one_query struct
    3. Added a test for timeout in relaxed.c:saat_relaxed_and() -
       same place and conditions as when timeout_kops is tested.
    4. Added a build test qbash_timeout_check.pl
    
*** v1.5.115-OS developer1 07 November 2017 ***  Open Source candidate
    1. Modifying all the build tests to allow them to be open-sourced
       uncovered a few bugs.
    2. Improve implementation of multi_queries.
    
*** v1.5.116-OS developer1 16 November 2017 ***  Reinstating the ability
    to apply a query label to each result in a batch run.  (It was
    broken by the introduction of support for multi_queries.) Now the
    label must be given at the end of the query line, after an ASCII
    GS character (0x1D).
    1. Various changes to QBASHQ.c and QBASHQ_lib.c to achieve the
    above.
    2. Added a qbash_batch_query_labels_check.pl script.
    
*** v1.5.117-OS developer1 21 Nov 2017 *** Arranging to output some
    codes to indicate what type of query shortening occurred.
    
*** v1.5.118-OS developer1 23 Nov 2017 *** Implementation of a new way
    of handling queries containing repeated top-level words.  SAAT
    blocks of type SAAT_WORD now have a repetition_count member.
    Saat_skipto() calls a leaf_peek_tf() function to check that
    a candidate containing at least one occurrence of a word, contains
    at least the required number.  Similarly, saat_setup() ensures
    that if the first posting contains too few occurrences,
    saat_skipto() is called to advance to one which contains at least
    the required number.

      * All build tests passed.
      * compare_results_from_different_exes.pl used to check that
        results are identical to those of previous version.
      * On lyrics queries with repeated words, average latency
        reduced by a factor of nearly 5 and maximum latency by
	a much larger factor.
       
*** v1.5.119-OS developer1 04 Dec 2017 *** Allowing display of up to
    three columns (without using display_col=0).  The value of
    display_col is repeatedly taken modulo 100 to determine which
    is the column to display.  Then, if display_col is
    still non zero after integer division by 100, the process is
    repeated.  Example: display_col=110204 will display column 11,
    then column 2, then column four.  Multiple columns displayed in
    this way are separated by " +++ ".
    
*** v1.5.120-OS developer1 05 Dec 2017 *** Fixing some bugs in the
    string substitution logic.

*** v1.5.121-OS developer1 12 Dec 2017 *** Removing the "repeated terms"
    heuristic from query_shortening.  Now that we have an efficient
    way of handling repeated terms, it's better to leave them in.
    Query_shortening_threshold is now applied to the number of
    distinct terms.
    
*** v1.5.122-OS developer1 13 Dec 2017 *** Fixing a small bug which
    appended an asterisk to queries.  QBASHQ_lib.c:
    replace_controls_in_line(). It was replacing newlines with '*'
    
*** v1.5.123-OS developer1 02 Jan 2017 *** Adapting to incompatible
    MacOS definition of qsort_r() (different order of parameters both
    in qsort_r() call and in call to comparison function.
    
*** v1.5.124-OS developer1 03 Jan 2017 *** Arranging to print a
    warning message (in debug mode only) when a substitution rule
    contains no TAB character.  This change made because developer2
    found that TABs in the file had been mysteriously replaced with
    spaces.  At the same time, significantly improve the usefulness of
    info about substitution rules which is printed when debug >= 1

*** Minor changes to Makefile contributed by Joel Mackintosh, RMIT ***

*** v1.5.125-OS developer1 04 Jan 2017 *** It turned out that
    developer2's substitution_rules file had CR NL rather than just NL
    and that that was the cause of the problem. Fixing that now.

*** v1.5.126-OS developer1 08 Jan 2017 *** 
    1. Change to read QBASH.substitution_rules rather than
       QBASH.substitution_rules_<language>.
    2. In assign_one_arg() check that the length of a value supplied
       for -language= comprises exactly two ASCII letters and lower case
       them.
    3. Change the language= attribute in arg_parser.c to no longer be
       immutable. I.e. it can now be changed on a per-query basis.
    4. Overhaul the substitutions code to use a hash accessed by
       2-letter language code e.g. fr or ZH to store the rule-sets
       for an arbitrary number of languages.
    	- Change the load, unload and apply_rules functions in
          substitutions.c
	- Change the query_environment_t structure to reference
	  the substitutions_hash.
    5. Modify the build tests relating to substitutions to work with
       the new model.
    6. Add a 'verbose' parameter to dahash_create() to avoid clutter
       in query processing output.
       
	  
*** v1.5.127-OS developer1 10 Jan 2017 ***
    1. Removing classifier_segment option (Segment rules will be
       applied if classifier_mode != 0 AND QBASH.segment_rules exists
    2. Removing /ifdeffing out the hard-coded segment rules
    3. Producing QBASH.segment_rules files to match the former
       hard-coded rules.
    4. Modifications to allow QBASH.segment-rules to be loaded using
       same data structures and functions as QBASH.substitution_rules
    5. Code to load the segment rules.
    6. Change the order of application of segment_rules and
       substitution_rules.  The former should come first, otherwise
       segment intent rules might be mangled before they can be
       recognized.
    7. Checking (using a MSFT-internal test) that segment_rules and
       substitution rules work in combination.
    
*** v1.5.128-OS developer1 16 Jan 2017 ***
    1. Improving the comment above handle_multi_query() in
       qbashq-lib/QBASHQ_lib.c
    2. Adding the ability to include comments (# introducer) in
       substitution_rules and segment_rules files.  Either a line
       by itself or in the third field after the language code.
    
*** v1.5.129-OS developer1 24 Jan 2017 ***
    1. The -classifier_min_words option can be used to avoid false
       positives, e.g. {mp3}.  Changed implementation to apply this
       limit immediately after stripping and stopping.  Motivating
       examples  {' ' ' ' ' mp3} gets stripped down to one word and is
       unlikely to have lyrics intent.  However {lyrics to the song
       Help!} also reduces to one word after application of segment
       rules but we can be confident that there is a lyrics intent.
       
*** v1.5.130-OS developer1 24 Jan 2017 ***
    1. Some false positives arise in lyrics classification for queries
       comprising only single letter words.  E.g. {y o u t u b e . c o
       m}.  Introduced a classifier_longest_wdlen_min, default
       value 2, meaning that the a query whose longest word length is
       less than 2 bytes results in instant rejection.

*** v1.5.131-OS developer1 25 Jan 2018 ***
    1. Query shortening in classifier mode runs the danger that the
       removal of out-of-vocabulary words results in a query with very
       few, sometimes only one word, or even none.  If that word is
       very common, like 'the' then there will be hundreds of million
       candidates to futilely examine, leading to huge latency.
       The change applied here is to return an instant negative
       decision if the shortened query is less than
       classifier_min_words (when there were no query intent words) or
       a slightly shorter limit if intent words were detected.
    
*** v1.5.132-OS developer1 05 Feb 2018 ***
    1. Fixing a length error for the segment_rules entry in split_filelist_arg()
